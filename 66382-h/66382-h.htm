<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">
Here</span> you are, then, Sis! Here you are&mdash;at
last!”</p>

<p>The final words, spoken in a tone of complete
satisfaction, accompanied a daring
dive of hand and arm through the open window of the
still moving railway-carriage.</p>

<p>“You ridiculous boy! We are only five minutes
behind time!” Frances seized the intruding hand in
a firm grip; and, as the train stopped, leaned out of
the window to bestow a sisterly hug. “Its good to
see you, dear! How brown and jolly you look! The
country agrees with you, Austin; I thought it would.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. It was fearfully slow here at
first, after Allerton. Of course, now&mdash;. Oh, come
along, Frances! I’ve heaps to tell you, once we’re on
the road. I wouldn’t bring the trap, because I wanted
time for a good talk all to ourselves; and I knew the
mile walk from the station to Woodend wouldn’t
frighten you. Toss out the parcels! I suppose you’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
a few dozen. What, only one? Hallo! they’ve taught
you something at school.”</p>

<p>Frances nodded her head reflectively. “Much you
know about that yet, my son. Wait awhile, and I’ll
enlighten you!”</p>

<p>Delivering herself of this promise,&mdash;which was
received by the boy with an impudent little shrug,&mdash;the
girl sprang to the platform in a style strongly
suggestive of past triumphs in her school gymnasium,
and then proceeded to catch her brother by the
shoulders and give him what she called “a proper
look-over”.</p>

<p>Austin stood the examination well. Though slightly
built, he was broad of chest and straight of limb; his
blue eyes were bright and clear; and the weakness of
his mouth was usually discounted by the sunny smile
which readily parted his lips. Nearly three years
younger than his sister, and accustomed to look to
her for companionship, guidance, and encouragement,
Austin had found the months of their separation so
real a trial that his joy in their present meeting was
particularly demonstrative. He remembered in a flash
of thought half a score of promising projects which
had been allowed to lapse until Frances should come
home from Haversfield College. And now Frances
was here in front of him, and surveying him with the
steady gray eyes he knew and truly loved&mdash;Frances
herself, no whit spoiled by her two terms at the famous
school for girls, though in Austin’s mind there had
lurked some fears of long skirts, hair “done up”, and&mdash;worse
than all!&mdash;airs of condescending superiority
and adult wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Frances did not look at all grown-up. She was just
a healthy, happy lass of barely fourteen years; frankly
preferring short frocks to long ones, and in no haste
for the time when hair-dressing should become a
troublesome solemnity. So far, life had made small
demands on her individuality. At home, she had
known no special duty except the care of Austin, who
had been rather delicate in early childhood; at school,
she had been one of many, fairly successful in her
work, more than fairly successful at games and bodily
exercises, and perhaps showing promise chiefly in a
susceptibility to all those influences which tend to
widen a young girl’s sympathies and draw out her
intelligence. Frances had been fortunate in her recent
experience&mdash;Haversfield is an excellent nursery for
the best kind of girlhood. Its many house-mistresses
are chosen by the Principal with extreme care; and
Frances had been under the charge of Miss Cliveden,
a clever, cultivated, and liberal-minded woman, whose
training was quite as valuable for heart as for head.
The brightest-witted, most thoughtful, and most
generous pupils of Haversfield were proud to call
themselves “Miss Cliveden’s girls”.</p>

<p>“Is Mamma all right?” inquired Frances, releasing
her brother after a little satisfied shake.</p>

<p>“Right as she can be. Ten deep in tea-drinkings,
and particular friends with all the world. No, not
with all the world&mdash;with the most particular world
of Woodend. She’s ‘At Home’ this afternoon, you
know. First and third Thursdays, and all that
twaddle&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Austin!” laughed Frances, faintly reproachful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it is! Fancy a lot of women staring at
each other over tea-cups and cake, and two odd men
tripping about among the crew and wishing themselves
at Kamschatka!”</p>

<p>“Who are the two?”</p>

<p>“Any tame sparrows caught in the trap.”</p>

<p>“You ought to watch them, and learn what you’ve
to grow up to.”</p>

<p>“Catch me!”</p>

<p>“But Mamma is well?” persisted Frances. “And
she likes Woodend, and her new house&mdash;you’re sure?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose so!” exclaimed Austin, showing signs
of impatience.</p>

<p>“She left Allerton for your sake, and I think you
ought to remember that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t preach!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you be ridiculous,” said Frances sharply.
“I’ve no patience with boys who call every sensible
word ‘preaching’.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no patience with girls who are everlastingly
‘sensible’.”</p>

<p>Frances’s frowns vanished, and smiles came instead.
Her sisterly prerogative of “preaching” was so seldom
exercised that Austin usually took her mild rebukes
like a lamb. His laugh echoed hers just now, and
he gave an affectionate hug to the arm he clung to.
Brother and sister were walking at a good pace along
the straggling white road to the village.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Sis. You shall preach as much as
you like&mdash;to-day. And Mater is really all right&mdash;she
must be. She has loads of friends already.”</p>

<p>“Loads! In a tiny place like this!” commented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Frances, gazing about her. On either hand stretched
the green meadows, watered by brooks filled with
recent rain; in front, the country spread smiling and
serene under the brilliant sun of late July. Immediately
before them, the road dipped into a shallow
wooded valley, studded on both sides with houses of
every degree. Farther off, above the trees of Fencourt
Park (the home of Woodend’s chief landlord), could be
descried the broken ridges of Rowdon Common. All
these interesting facts were duly pointed out by Austin,
with the justifiable airs and pride of a resident; while
Frances, as a new-comer, merely listened or asked
sagacious questions.</p>

<p>“That’s where we hang out,” remarked the boy
elegantly, while waving his hand towards a long,
picturesquely-built house on the opposite side of the
valley. “It’s a tidy crib, with lots of room.”</p>

<p>“A crib&mdash;with lots of room! A pretty confusion of
terms, young man.”</p>

<p>“I’ve bagged a jolly place for larks,” continued
Austin eagerly. “There’s a stove in it and a splendid
big table, and a bath-room next door, which will just
do for our photography.”</p>

<p>The boy’s face, uplifted to his sister’s, was full of
the happy enthusiasm which feels itself secure of
sympathy; and Frances’s heart beat high with pleasure
because her welcome home was of this joyful
sort. For the absent school-girl, like her brother, had
known some fears&mdash;lest the six months’ parting should
have taught Austin to do without her. The boy had
proved a poor correspondent; and it was not easy for
Frances with her warm, unselfish temperament, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
realize that unanswered letters did not necessarily
signify failing affection.</p>

<p>“That’s the church&mdash;it’s splendid for photographing,
if only one could get the lines of the tower straight.
And there’s the rectory alongside. The Rector’s very
old; but a good sort, like the curate.”</p>

<p>“The curate is Mr. Carlyon, your tutor, isn’t he?
Oh, Austin, do you like having lessons with him?”
asked Frances, with intense interest. Her reverence
for knowledge had grown of late, and she wanted,
not unnaturally, to find out whether in this direction
Austin’s steps had progressed with her own.</p>

<p>“I like it well enough. You see,” he added awkwardly,
“I’m not exactly a grind; one must use one’s
wits, but I think mine go best with my hands. Only,
Carlyon was a swell at Oxford, and he’s got a way of
making one think one wouldn’t mind being a swell
too.”</p>

<p>Frances looked relieved and quite contented.</p>

<p>“Then he knows a straight ball when he sees one,”
Austin continued, “and he’s a crack with his bat.
Then when lessons are on, he doesn’t drone away everlastingly
about dead-and-gone chaps. There’s one of
his cranks we all approve of, somehow.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“We’ve half an hour every day for what he chooses
to call ‘current events’. Carlyon tells us what’s
going on in the world, reads bits out of papers and
talks them over, and gives marks to the fellows who
remember best.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Austin! I hope you get most marks!” interrupted
Frances, with the utterly unreasonable ambition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
of a sister. Austin felt that he was wanting, and
replied grumpily:</p>

<p>“Hang it, I’d like to know what chance I have!
The other chaps hear things at home. Mater won’t
let me look at a paper, and never talks to me about
what she reads herself.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Frances, “I’ll hunt out the news
for you, and read the things up, and send you off all
ready crammed. I shall like doing it.”</p>

<p>“I know you will,” groaned Austin. “I say,
Frances, you’ll shine like the sun at our ‘symposia’&mdash;I
hope you like that pretty word, Ma’am!”</p>

<p>“What are your symposia?” chuckled Frances, beginning
to think Woodend couldn’t be so much behind
Haversfield itself.</p>

<p>“Why, on Saturday mornings Carlyon takes his
boys, and his sister takes her girls, and we’ve a meeting
in the big rectory dining-room. Then the lot of us
talk like fits about those blessed ‘current events’
our respected teachers have been driving into us all
the week. It’s prime fun, once we get started.
Carlyon and his sister do the starting. When they’re
on opposite sides, we’ve rare larks; for they pitch into
one another like mad&mdash;quite civilly, you know. Then
we chaps and Miss Carlyon’s crew follow suit, and go
for one another in fine style. Gracious! You should
have heard Max Brenton and Florry Fane last Saturday!
It was our breaking-up day, and we had an
extra grand symposium. Max and Florry are no end
good at argufying.”</p>

<p>Frances heard the names of these friends of Austin
with the pleasant anticipations natural to a sociable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
girl just about to make trial of a new home, new
surroundings, new companions. She hoped this “Max
and Florry” would be “good” for something besides
“argufying”&mdash;good for comradeship of the only kind
possible to a nature whose characteristics were deep-rooted
and strong. Half-hearted alliances were outside
Frances’s comprehension; her love and trust must
be given freely and fully, or not at all.</p>

<p>“In her last letter Mamma told me I was to be one
of Miss Carlyon’s girls after the holidays. That will
seem funny at first, now that I have got used to a big
school. It was nice at Haversfield, Austin. I want
to stay with Mamma and you, of course, else I should
like to go back. Miss Cliveden&mdash;my house-mistress&mdash;was
so jolly. She used to make one feel as if one
wanted to be of some good, if one could.”</p>

<p>“You can be of lots of good here,” said Austin
comfortably. “It’s no sense a fellow having a sister
if she’s away at school. Max says if he had a sister
he’d think himself lucky, for she would be able to
teach him how to make a bed properly. That’s a
thing he often needs to do for his worst cases, and he
does not quite understand it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Austin declined to explain. At the moment he was
too much occupied with his own affairs to have leisure
for Max’s. He was eager to convince Frances that
she could be of supreme use to him personally; and
Frances, before whose eyes had lately gleamed a
vision of a wider range for her girlish energies,
listened, and sympathized, and promised, as only the
best of sisters could. She was quite sure that Austin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
wanted her most of all. He always had wanted her,
and she never had disappointed him.</p>

<p>They had been brought up together, and educated
by the same governesses and tutors until a few months
before this story opens. Then Austin’s childish delicacy
had for the first time threatened to become
serious, and his mother had carried him off to London
for distinguished medical advice. For years Mrs.
Morland’s home had been in Allerton, a large provincial
town to which she had first been attracted
because it was the dwelling-place of an old friend,
who had since passed away. The London doctors
recommended a country life for Austin; and, after
some weeks of search for a suitable spot, Mrs. Morland
fixed on Woodend, a village which had everything
desirable in the way of soil, air, and scenery. Her
household gods were removed from Allerton to Woodend
in the course of a bright April, and she and her
son settled down in the pretty home she had bought
and furnished.</p>

<p>During all this time of unrest, Frances had been
quietly at work at Haversfield, where she had been
sent in order that her education might not be interrupted.
She had spent the Easter holidays with a
school friend, because at the time her mother was
superintending the removal to Woodend, and Austin
was paying a visit to a Scotch cousin.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Morland had guessed under what influences
her daughter would come, she certainly would not have
sent her to Haversfield. Not only had she no regard
for the “learned lady”, but she set no value at all
upon the womanly accomplishments which were unable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
to secure social prestige. Miss Cliveden’s definition of
“society” would have astonished Mrs. Morland; and
her gospel of labour, preached with her lips and in
her life, would have seemed to Frances’s mother
uniquely dull and quixotic.</p>

<p>Miss Cliveden taught her girls to love work, to love
it best when done for others, and to reverence all
work truly and faithfully accomplished. The nobility
of honest labour was her favourite theme, and the
allurements of altruistic toil the highest attraction she
could hold out to her young scholars. As her pupils
were all in the upper forms of the college, Frances
was one of the youngest of them, and Miss Cliveden
took a great liking for the frank-hearted, winning
lass. Thrown chiefly among the elder girls, Frances
soon caught their spirit and shared their ambitions,
while remaining in ways and thoughts a thorough
child.</p>

<p>By the time Mrs. Morland was comfortably settled
in Woodend, she began to grow tired of petting and
coddling a wayward, restless boy. Scotland and the
country air had brought Austin back to fair health,
and his bright eyes and rosy cheeks assured his mother
that her sacrifice had not been in vain. Mrs. Morland
loved ease of mind and body. She thought it time
her boy should return to his lesson-books, and that
Frances&mdash;so soon as her second term at Haversfield
should be over&mdash;should come home to help him.</p>

<p>The terms of his father’s will had decreed that
Austin should be educated privately. Mr. Morland had
disliked public schools. His wife regretted the social
disadvantage, but could not overrule her husband’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
decision; and she began to face the trouble of looking
out for a new tutor. Before she had looked long, she
discovered that Mr. Carlyon, the young curate of
Woodend church, took pupils; and Austin became one
of them for the greater part of the summer term.</p>

<p>“What sort of place is Woodend?” asked Frances.</p>

<p>“Oh, well&mdash;nice enough. Some jolly fellows among
the boys, and plenty of girls to match. I dare say
you’ll like Florry Fane, anyhow. She has lots of
pluck, and doesn’t bounce, though she’s no end clever.
Then there’s roly-poly Betty Turner&mdash;and May Gordon&mdash;and
the First Violin.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the First Violin?”</p>

<p>“We’ve a boys’ and girls’ band, and she’s the leader.
Everybody calls her the First Violin. She hardly
moves without her fiddle; and she <i>can</i> play.”</p>

<p>“What about your fiddle? Haven’t you joined the
band, lazy imp?”</p>

<p>“Had to; Miss Carlyon wouldn’t let me off. Besides,
it’s good fun. We’ve a master to train us, and he
gives me lessons alone as well. I practise sometimes,”
added Austin hastily, “so you needn’t worry.”</p>

<p>Frances felt on this golden afternoon even less inclined
than usual to “preach”, so she let the fiddle
pass.</p>

<p>“Are there any poor folks in the village?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Crowds!&mdash;at least, Max says so. He’s always
abusing Sir Arthur Fenn&mdash;chap who lives at Fencourt,
the biggest place about. That’s to say, Fencourt
and most of Woodend belong to him; but he’s hardly
ever here. He’s got a grander place somewhere, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
that’s why he doesn’t care much about this one, and
won’t do much for the people.”</p>

<p>“What a shame!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,&mdash;they’re such a rough lot, no decent
folk would want to go near them.”</p>

<p>“I should!” declared Frances warmly. “I’d love to
try to help people who were very poor and miserable.”</p>

<p>“Gracious!” cried Austin, laughing merrily. “I
declare, you’re as bad as Max. He’ll show you the
way about, if you want to be mixed up in charity
soup and blankets!”</p>

<p>“Why!&mdash;what should a boy know about such
things?” said Frances, laughing too.</p>

<p>“Max isn’t <i>a</i> boy, as you’ll soon discover. He’s <i>the</i>
boy. The one and only Max Brenton. My grammar
doesn’t amount to much, but I know Max is of the
singular number.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“He’s the son of Doctor Brenton&mdash;the one and only
son of the one and only doctor!”</p>

<p>“Is Dr. Brenton as singular as Max?”</p>

<p>“More so, my dear!&mdash;yes, if possible, more so!” returned
Austin, grimacing expressively. “You see,
they’ve brought each other up, and it’s sort of mixed
which is which. So they’re ‘the old Doc’ and ‘the
young Doc’ to all Woodend,&mdash;and a jolly good sort
they both are!” continued the boy heartily. “If Max
weren’t always so fearfully busy, he’d be the chummiest
chum a fellow could want.”</p>

<p>“What is he so busy about?” asked Frances, enjoying
the description of this mysterious Max.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;soup and blankets!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“Fact.”</p>

<p>“You are a provoking scamp!”</p>

<p>“Respected student of distinguished Haversfield
(as Florry would say), if you put me on to construe
for an hour I couldn’t ‘render into tolerable English’
the sayings and doings of Max Brenton&mdash;the one and
only Max Brenton! He’s not to be understood. You
must just take him as you find him; and if you don’t
meet him to-day, hope you’ll come across him to-morrow.
And now, don’t you want to know if the
tennis-court is in good order, and if you’re going to
have cake for tea?”</p>

<p>Frances laughed, and yielded herself up to home
matters. For a time the brother and sister exchanged
question and answer at a great rate, and held a lively
discussion as to the possibilities of Elveley. Austin
was full of talk about his chosen playroom and its
entrancing conveniences. Frances planned the arrangement
of cunning nooks for her personal possessions,
and promised to give her whole mind to the study of
photography, until she had solved the problems presented
by the camera which had been a present to
Austin from the Scotch cousin.</p>

<p>The young pair chuckled and chattered like magpies,
and were so deep in their concerns that a boy, coming
at full speed round a corner from the village, almost
ran into them before he attracted their attention.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” cried Austin, “there’s Max!”</p>

<p>“The one and only Max?”</p>

<p>“No other. What’s in the wind now? Small-pox
or scarlet-fever?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“How fast he runs!”</p>

<p>“Max hardly ever walks&mdash;he hasn’t time. Hi!
Hallo!”</p>

<p>Austin slipped his hand from Frances’s arm, dived
adroitly on one side, and managed to catch his friend
in headlong course.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” panted Max, in return. “So sorry, old
chap; I didn’t see it was you.” He disengaged himself
and stepped with outstretched hand towards Austin’s
sister. “And this is Miss Frances?” he continued,
smiling frankly.</p>

<p>“Rather!” remarked Austin, with a certain gracious
condescension, as becomes one whose sister is of the
right sort to make sisterless fellows envious. “I’ve
been telling her what a singular number you are;
and she wants to go shares in your soup-and-blanket
business.”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully jolly of her,” said Max, who had meanwhile
exchanged with Frances a comrade’s grasp. “We
wanted some more girls badly in Woodend.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Austin slyly.</p>

<p>“At all events, we wanted <i>a</i> girl,” insisted Max.</p>

<p>“Frances isn’t <i>a</i> girl, she’s <i>the</i> girl; the one and
only Frances, who will soon be the sworn ally of the
one and only Max.”</p>

<p>“All the better for me!” laughed Max. “Will you
really, though, Miss Frances?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to,” replied the girl, smiling at this busy
boy’s pleasant, eager face.</p>

<p>“I’ll hold you to it,” declared Max. “I must say
good-bye, for see here!”</p>

<p>Laughing heartily, Max tapped his bulging pockets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>“What is it?” inquired Frances.</p>

<p>“Pills and potions!&mdash;so I must cut!” He lifted his
cap, sang out a gay farewell, and was off at his former
excellent pace.</p>

<p>“What a nice boy!” exclaimed Frances, still beaming.
“At least, of course I don’t know much about him yet,
but he looks nice.”</p>

<p>“He’s a good sort,” said Austin again, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Why does he carry his father’s medicines? Hasn’t
Dr. Brenton a proper person&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Max thinks he is a proper person.”</p>

<p>“What does he do about them when he’s at school?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t come to school, except for a few hours
in the week. He learns classics and mathematics
with us&mdash;his father has taught him the rest. Dr.
Brenton couldn’t possibly get on all day without Max.
You’ll soon understand why. Now, Frances, we’ll be
in Woodend directly. I hate crawling down a hill
when I’m hot, so I’m going full pelt till I get to the
bottom of this one. Don’t you hurry. I’ll wait for
you there.”</p>

<p>“Will you, though?” demanded Frances with scorn.
And Austin’s last fears about the effects of Haversfield
vanished when his sister darted forward, overtook
him easily, passed him triumphantly, and made her
entry into Woodend at a speed which showed no
concern either for her sailor-hat or her dignity.</p>

<p>“I said she was <i>the</i> Frances!” murmured Austin, as
with a great affectation of indifference he jogged along
behind.</p>

<small>BOYS AND GIRLS TOGETHER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Though he counted the Doctor’s son as first and
chief, Austin undoubtedly had plenty of friends;
and since the time of his coming to Woodend he had
done his best to prepare the way for Frances by industriously
singing her praises. The young people who
had managed hitherto to exist in the village without
either Austin or Frances might have been severely
bored but for the agreeable curiosity roused by Austin’s
descriptions of his absent sister. The Woodend boys
were really anxious to make the acquaintance of so
remarkable a girl. The Woodend lassies, having a
good opinion of Austin, were willing to expect great
things of Austin’s sister. Both boys and girls indulged
the hope that the new-comer into their little world
might rouse in it some pleasant stir.</p>

<p>They knew that they needed badly a stimulus of
some sort to give fresh energy to their rather monotonous
lives. They had their games and pastimes,
like other youngsters; but these suffered in attraction
for want of competition. The cricket-team and tennis-club
rarely found rivals with whom they might contend
in honourable warfare. Woodend was not exactly
remote; but it had a special population of upper-class
residents, who loved its pure air and fine scenery, and
had no neighbours of like tastes and habits in the
villages near at hand. The young folks played and
worked contentedly enough among themselves as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
rule; but they were growing just a little tired of each
other, and there was nobody to lead.</p>

<p>The girls&mdash;poor things!&mdash;were in worst case. The
boys, when they had turned fourteen or fifteen, were
usually sent to a public school. The girls remained at
home, with so much time on their hands that they
could not even enjoy the luxury of being idle&mdash;it was
too common an experience.</p>

<p>The Carlyons&mdash;Edward and Muriel&mdash;were working,
in part, a reformation. Edward Carlyon, Master of
Arts of Oxford University, had established a small
private school for boys; Muriel Carlyon, sometime
student of Girton College, and graduate of London,
had done as much for the girls. The Woodend
youngsters of good degree flocked to Wood Bank,&mdash;formerly
the home of an artist,&mdash;where Edward taught
his boys in the big, dismantled studio, and Muriel
consecrated a couple of fair-sized rooms to her girls.
The coming of Austin Morland, who, though only in
his twelfth year, had a certain talent for leadership,
had waked up the boys’ schoolroom, and plans for
the summer holidays had been more ambitious than
usual.</p>

<p>Frances could not do anything striking for the
girls’ schoolrooms at present, since they were shut, and
their presiding genius was away from home. But
Austin’s sister, finding herself welcomed in a fashion
which showed how unstinted had been Austin’s recommendations,
was determined to do her best to
justify his loyalty. She was soon the happy potentate
of an acquiescent kingdom, and honestly anxious to
make good use of her unexpected influence. Besides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
being the leader in every frolic, she tried to interest
herself in everybody’s hobbies and everybody’s fancies.</p>

<p>Most of her new friends belonged to one or other of
the many juvenile organizations which now make a
real effort&mdash;whose value may be appreciated by social
economists of a later date&mdash;to concern themselves in
the welfare of the poor and suffering. Frances had
caught from her elder comrades at Haversfield a
girlish enthusiasm for this kind of toil. She threw
herself warmly into the diversions of Florry Fane’s
set&mdash;who could understand poetry, dabble in oil and
water colours, and write stories. She dressed dolls for
Betty Turner’s hospital box, she collected butterflies
and beetles with Guy Gordon, she studied rabbits
with Frank Temple, she joined the Children’s Orchestra
and was a great admirer of the First Violin.</p>

<p>But the best of Frances’s heart went into her promised
alliance with Max Brenton. Max was the
blithest boy in all Woodend, by far the busiest and
the most popular. Even Austin Morland, bright of
face and gay of manner as was the lad, could not, and
would not, have stepped into the place filled by Max.
Meet the Doctor’s son when and where you might, you
were bound to feel happier for having done so.</p>

<p>Elveley was the largest house in Woodend proper;
it possessed ample garden ground, and neat outbuildings
in the rear. Its possessor had usually been the
person of most importance in the village, and thus the
coming of the new owner had been awaited with
curiosity. Mrs. Morland had been at some pains to
send in advance her credentials as to family and
position. She was a woman who placed extravagant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
value on social esteem, and she had voluntarily stunted
her intelligence and narrowed her views for fear of
perilling her own prestige by shocking any antique
prejudice in her neighbours. She had not much sympathy
with the special affairs of childhood; but when
she turned aside from her individual interests to see
how matters went with her boy and girl, she generally
found reason for complacency.</p>

<p>Now that she had settled in Woodend, it was in
harmony with her wishes and instincts that Frances
should be to the girls such a leader as Mrs. Morland
had become to their elders, and that Austin’s careless
good-humour should assure his popularity. If her
children had been dull and commonplace, she would
have felt herself an injured person. Because they
were neither, she was ready to be indulgent and compliant.
They had plenty of pocket-money, and were
seldom refused a petition; and though they rarely
spent with their mother more than an hour or so in
the day, their food and clothing were carefully attended
to by responsible people, and their education
was the best within reach. Frances and Austin were
not aware that they missed anything; and they
nourished for their mother a love which, if it depended
rather on tradition than on fact, was sufficiently real
to make their home dear and fairly bright.</p>

<p>The big playroom in Mrs. Morland’s delightful old
house soon became the headquarters of every juvenile
institution. Cricket, football, and tennis clubs kept
their archives in its table-drawers; its shelves harboured
a choice lending-library, contributed to by
every owner of a story-book; its corners saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
hatching of every plot, harmless or mischievous.
Further, it was within its walls that Frances&mdash;intent
at first only on aiding Max, but with wider ambition
by and by&mdash;founded and maintained her prosperous
club, the Woodend Society of Altruists.</p>

<p>“I hope the name is fine enough,” remarked Austin
critically.</p>

<p>“You don’t think it sounds priggish?” inquired
Frances in alarm. “It’s what the Haversfield girls
called their club, and I thought we might just copy.”</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s a first-rate name,” declared Max
kindly.</p>

<p>“What are Altruists?” asked in humble tones a
small and rosy-cheeked boy.</p>

<p>“They are only people who try to help others,”
replied Frances; and this simple explanation, given
with a gentle sincerity of voice and manner, seemed
to satisfy everybody. Indeed, everybody present at a
fairly representative meeting of the Woodend young
folks became an Altruist on the spot.</p>

<p>“What have we got to do?” said the rosy-cheeked
boy anxiously.</p>

<p>“Sign our names in the book of the Society and
keep the rules,” said Florry Fane. “Frances must
sign hers first, because she’s the founder of the club.”</p>

<p>“Florry and I have written down the rules we
thought might do,” said Frances modestly, “Florry
is going to read them out, and then if any boy or girl
will suggest improvements we shall be very much
obliged.”</p>

<p>But nobody wished to improve the excellent rules
drawn up by Frances and Florry. The words in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the Altruist Code was expressed were few, and so well
chosen that no careless member could pretend either
to have forgotten or to have misunderstood.</p>

<p>In becoming an Altruist everybody undertook to do
his or her very best to lighten the loads of dwellers
within or without the gates of happy Woodend homes.
This was an ambitiously comprehensive scheme, but
nothing less thorough would suit Frances and her
allies. Nor did they intend that their new club
should exist only on paper; and so their rules provided
that by appropriate deeds alone could a continued
membership be ensured.</p>

<p>The boys and girls were so truly in want of a fresh
sensation to give zest to their holiday hours that they
were in some danger of riding their new hobby-horse
to death. The Altruists grew in number and flourished
exceedingly. They found their parents ready with
approval and support; and when they had passed
through an embryo stage of rash philanthropic excitement,
they settled down into a capital club, whose
motto of “Help Others” was something more than a
vain boast. Of course the new Society must have
funds&mdash;how otherwise provide for necessary outlay?
Members loyally sacrificed a percentage of pocket-money,
which was liberally reinforced&mdash;at the instigation
of Mrs. Morland&mdash;by adult subscriptions. The
mothers of young Altruists searched their cupboards
for old linen, blankets, and clothing, wherewith to
start the Society’s stores. The fathers promised that
appeals for fruit and flowers should have their best
consideration. Dr. Brenton sent word through Max
that he would accept as a “gratis” patient any sick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
person tended and cared for by an Altruist. Mrs.
Morland, well pleased that Frances should enjoy the
prestige owing to a founder, sent for a carpenter, and
desired him to make any alterations the children might
order, with the view of rendering their playroom satisfactory
Headquarters for their club.</p>

<p>As soon as the Carlyons came home, Muriel was
waited on by a deputation of her girls, who wanted
her to be Honorary President of the Altruists. Miss
Carlyon was very ready to agree, and to give Frances
credit for a really bright idea.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why your club shouldn’t do ever such
great things for the Woodend poor folk,” declared
Muriel warmly. “I shall be proud to be one of you,
and so will my brother; and you must count on us for
all the help we can give.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Carlyon!” said Frances shyly, “we
thought perhaps we might just help <i>you</i>&mdash;a little.”</p>

<p>“We’ll help each other, dear. And then we shall be
Altruists among ourselves. I can assure you, I think,
besides being useful, we shall be very jolly.”</p>

<p>And so it proved. None of the club meetings were
more spirited or more mirthful than those at which
the Honorary President made her appearance; and the
frequent presence of Edward Carlyon encouraged his
boys to stand firmly by the Society, and to lose all fear
that they were “benevolent prigs”, as they had been
called by Jack Shorter. Jack was the only one of
Carlyon’s boys who had possessed sufficient unamiability
to remain outside the club. At last, finding
himself sent to Coventry, Jack repented and became
an embarrassingly active Altruist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>When the Wood Bank schoolrooms opened their
doors for the autumn term, it was discovered that the
Carlyons intended their support to be anything but
“honorary”. They had fitted up a large basement
room as a workshop for various handicrafts, and there
the boys and girls learned to make all sorts of things
for the Society’s stores. Out of doors, a shed held all
kinds of necessary tools, and the young folks studied
practical gardening, with intent to aid such villagers
as might own neglected plots. Sewing-meetings produced
a wonderful collection of garments, new and
renovated, which helped to fill Frances’s clothing-cupboard.
The juvenile choir and orchestra made free
offers of their services; and lads and lassies with a
talent for “reading and recitation” were in enormous
request.</p>

<p>Frances’s days were busy and happy. She enjoyed
her school-work with Muriel Carlyon, a teacher of the
class to which she had grown accustomed at Haversfield.
Muriel’s system of teaching was not without
originality; and her love of outdoor occupations hindered
her from possessing the traditional characteristics
of a blue-stocking. Her brother Edward was a
muscular, well-built young Englishman, whose college
triumphs had not prevented respectable attainments
with scull and bat. The Carlyons took a lively interest
in their pupils, whom they treated and trained with a
success which would have astonished primmer pedagogues.
Their boys and girls trooped to school together,
and often measured wits or muscles in their class-rooms
or their play-grounds. Thus their friendships
were closer and more sympathetic than those of lads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
and lassies usually are. They learned to appreciate
one another’s tastes and dispositions, and to sacrifice
individual whims to the common good.</p>

<p>Autumn drifted into winter with the coming of a
bleak November. Football and hockey were in full
swing in the playing-fields. The little ones had built
their first snow-man; and the rubbing and oiling of
skates followed careful studies of the barometer. The
youngsters were now in some danger of forgetting the
duties of their Society. Their time had suddenly
assumed an incalculable value.</p>

<p>It was at this stage of affairs that Max Brenton one
day made his appearance at the door of the club-room,
wherein sat Frances busily posting up the Society’s
accounts.</p>

<p>“If you please,” began Max in a great hurry, “may
I have a blanket, two flannel petticoats, a three-year-old
frock, and a pair of very large old boots?”</p>

<p>Frances wrinkled her forehead. “I’m sorry we
have no flannel petticoats left, owing to a great
demand. I can manage the other things, except the
boots. We are quite out of very large boots. Couldn’t
one of you boys learn shoemaking?”</p>

<p>“I fancy that would be a little rough on the village
cobbler.”</p>

<p>“But the cobbler will do nothing he is not paid for;
and poor folks cannot always pay. It would be very
useful to have a shoemaker of our very own. We
could buy our leather and make it into enormous
boots. Gentleman-boots are really hardly any good
to us.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. But, please, may I have the things?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
And I will try my best to persuade somebody to learn
shoemaking.”</p>

<p>Frances rose, and stepped thoughtfully towards her
cupboard. Thence, after some searching, she extracted
a tiny garment of crimson serge, warmly lined and
neatly finished. To this she added two pairs of knitted
socks of the same cheerful hue.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say!” exclaimed Max, radiant. “May I really
have these awfully swell things? You girls are
bricks!”</p>

<p>“You boys helped to buy the stuff. I’m glad you
like the colour,” continued Frances graciously, “because
at the last sewing-meeting of our Society we
decided that for the future all the clothing we make
shall be scarlet or crimson, if it can be. It was Florry
Fane’s idea. She said it would be ‘the badge of all
our tribe’. We shall be able to tell our pensioners
the moment we see them. For instance, next time I
meet the little child who is to have this frock, I shall
think, ‘There goes an Altruist baby!’”</p>

<p>“I see. And next time I come across a hoary old
chap to whom you’ve given a crimson comforter, I
shall say, ‘There goes an Altruist antediluvian!’”</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Frances, “suppose you do? You’ll
allow that our colour is becoming. It’s bright and
picturesque; and by and by, when we’ve given away
lots of crimson things, think how gay Woodend will
look.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it will! As soon as a visitor reaches the
favoured spot, he’ll cry, ‘Hullo! here’s an Altruist
village!’”</p>

<p>“I hope he may. Now, tell me whom these things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
are for, because I must put the names down in our
clothing book.”</p>

<p>Max, remembering certain private labours of his own,
gazed in admiration at Frances’s neat records.</p>

<p>“The frock is for Polly Baker, child of Joseph
Baker, a dweller in Lumber’s Yard, and sometime a
tiller of the fields.”</p>

<p>Frances paused, her pen uplifted, and a serious
expression on her face.</p>

<p>“But, Max, Miss Carlyon says the Altruists oughtn’t
to help people who won’t help themselves. That
Joseph Baker is a lazy, selfish, good-for-nothing.”</p>

<p>“I know the gentleman. You’ve described him
mildly.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Carlyon has got him work over and over
again, but he always loses it.”</p>

<p>“No wonder, the drunken scamp!” muttered Max
under his breath.</p>

<p>“He is as bad as he can be.”</p>

<p>“True, dear Madam Altruist. But that isn’t the
fault of his daughter Polly, aged three.”</p>

<p>“Still, if Baker finds he can get his children fed
and clothed for nothing, he will go on spending all his
money in that dreadful inn in Lumber’s Yard.”</p>

<p>“He will go on doing that anyhow. Mr. Carlyon
isn’t easily beaten, but he has given up Joseph Baker,
Esquire. Meanwhile, Baker’s children would starve
if it were not for charity. Frances, Polly is such a
game little thing! You wouldn’t believe how she
stands up to her brute of a father when she sees him
ill-treat her mother. I’ve delivered her out of Baker’s
clutches more than once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Frances gazed at the speaker, her eyes widely-opened
and horrified.</p>

<p>“Max! You don’t mean he would hurt that baby?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t he? Doesn’t he, if he gets the chance?
He’s a&mdash;a&mdash;beast! Beg pardon!”</p>

<p>“It’s fearful!” sighed Frances, pausing perforce on
the threshold of the social problem which had risen
before her. “He ought to be punished.”</p>

<p>“He will be, when I’m big enough to thrash him,”
murmured Max; and Frances turned a face flushed
with sympathy to this chivalrous lad. “But don’t let
us punish our Altruist baby.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Max! When you wheedle&mdash;,” said the Altruist
secretary, shaking her head. “Here are your things,
and you must be responsible. Now, in return for your
pleasant news about Baker, I’ll tell you something
really nice. I have added up our funds, and I find we
have quite a lot of money; so I am getting ready a
list of ‘wants’, and to-morrow we will have a shopping
expedition. We girls shall need large supplies of
scarlet flannel and crimson serge to make into clothing
for our Christmas presents. You boys are sure to
require things for your workshops. We will take the
pony-carriage and drive into Exham. As to-morrow
will be Saturday, not many Altruists will care to leave
the playing-fields; but you will come, won’t you,
Max?”</p>

<p>“If Dad doesn’t want me.”</p>

<p>“And there will be Austin and Florry&mdash;four of us.
You and Austin can get the things for your own
work while Florry and I buy yards and yards of
flannel and serge and calico.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“Will there be room for us boys in the trap coming
home?” inquired Max meekly. “I’d like to know
whether, if the cargo weighs down the pony, you mean
to sacrifice us or the flannel?”</p>

<p>“You, of course!”</p>

<p>“Then I’d better bring provisions for camping out.
There’s a fall of the barometer, and all the village
weather-prophets tell me we are to have snow; besides,
there’s some rough road between here and
Exham. Look out for storms to-morrow, Frances!
Now, I’ll be off with my booty. Baker sold to a
fellow-cad the last frock I begged for Polly; but I’ll
dare him to touch this beauty. Keep your eyes open,
and they’ll be gladdened by the sight of the Altruist
baby!”</p>

<p>Max went away happy. All his father’s poor
patients enjoyed his personal attentions, and not a
few considered the Doctor’s son as good an adviser as
the Doctor himself. Max tried to be discreet, but his
boyish habit of telling the unvarnished truth to any
village sneak or bully sometimes brought him into
awkward predicaments.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>ADVENTURERS FOUR.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Surely only youth and health would look forward
with glorious anticipations to a five-mile drive
on a bitter winter day, in a little open carriage!</p>

<p>The four adventurous Altruists were certain they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
were going to enjoy themselves, and no sooner were
they fairly on their way than they began to justify
their own predictions. For the sake of extra excitement,
they took it in turns to drive; but it was impossible
for them to take it in turns to talk, so they all
chattered at once. This did not help the driving,
which was mixed in character. Nobody could quite
tell, as the ribbons changed hands, what might be the
next diversion; and, of course, this uncertainty was
the best part of the fun. At last the pony settled,
under the capable guidance of Florry, into a steady
trot; and the Altruists settled, at the same propitious
moment, into a steady discussion of their proposed
Christmas feast for the Woodend villagers.</p>

<p>This feast had been for some weeks under consideration
at the Society’s meetings, and the arrangement of
its details was far advanced. The Altruists intended
that it should be a grand manifesto of their good-will
to all the working-folk.</p>

<p>“We are to have a present for everybody,” declared
Austin loudly, “and we boys must do our share. I
am making my third stool. No one can say that
stools are not useful things in cottages.”</p>

<p>“But they will not furnish a house,” objected Max;
“and I want very badly a complete rig-out for a two-roomed
shanty. I have a man on my list who was
sold up last week by his Jew of a landlord&mdash;old Fenn.
Poor Johnson was a decent chap, but when they turned
him out he just went to the bad.”</p>

<p>“He can’t have gone very far in a week,” remarked
Austin, who had not taken kindly the allusion to his
handiwork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“He went to Fenn’s Home Farm, and tried to burn
the ricks. Fortunately he didn’t succeed; and when
Dad heard he was to be taken up, we went and begged
Johnson off. We’re going bail for him, that if they’ll
let him alone he’ll keep straight; and Dad has got him
some rough work in the gardens. But his wife and
child had to go to the workhouse; and now the idea
is to start them all afresh in one of Ventnor’s little
places. They’ll want only a few things to begin with.
What do you say, Frances? Shall we give him one
of Austin’s stools for a Christmas-box?”</p>

<p>“Something else as well,” said Frances, beaming on
her ally.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind making him an extra big stool, which
might do for a table,” said Austin graciously.</p>

<p>“Guy is mending-up some old chairs,” said Frances.</p>

<p>“Mamma will let me have one of her patchwork-carpets,”
said Florry. “She makes them out of odd
pieces begged from friends, and they are quite warm
and cheerful.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Temple offered me an old bedstead and bedding
only the other day,” cried Frances. “How
fortunate for poor Johnson! I’ll ask Mamma for a
chest of drawers.”</p>

<p>“And the Altruists as a body can easily produce a
‘harlequin’ set of plates and cups and dishes,” said
Florry.</p>

<p>“I have some spare pots and pans in my stores,”
added Frances proudly. “I declare, Max, your friend
sha’n’t wait till Christmas to set up housekeeping!”</p>

<p>“You are all awfully kind,” said Max gratefully.
The boy’s eyes were actually moist, and he hung his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
head; but in a moment had recovered sufficiently to
shout in vigorous crescendo:</p>

<p>“Your reins are crossed, Florry! Mercy on us,
we’re in the ditch!”</p>

<p>They were not quite there, thanks to the pony’s
objections to lead the way. Rough pulled his head
free indignantly, and was allowed to steer his own
course in peace.</p>

<p>The Altruist quartette presently arrived safely in
Exham. Max, who was then the whip, made for a
respectable inn, where the travellers left the much-enduring
Rough to take a rest, while they attended
to business.</p>

<p>“Ladies, do we have the honour of accompanying
you?” asked Austin, with a grand bow; “or do we go
off on our own hook?”</p>

<p>“As though we would take you two imps into shops
with us!” said Frances. “Go and buy your things
and we’ll get ours, then we can meet at Thorn’s and
have tea. Thorn is our confectioner, and Mamma said
we might order what we liked.”</p>

<p>“Good for Mater,” chuckled Austin. “But in the
meantime, can you girls really do without us?”</p>

<p>“We’ll try to,” said Frances severely; “and mind
you scamps keep out of mischief. Come on, Florry.”</p>

<p>The girls linked arms and marched off, affecting the
superior and independent airs so tantalizing to the best
of boys. Max and Austin watched their departure
with mischievous eyes.</p>

<p>“They’re too cocky for anything,” declared Austin.</p>

<p>“I believe they’ll buy up all the red stuff in Exham,”
said Max. “Observe the lofty tilt of Florry’s head.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Mark the aggressive decision of Frances’s step. They’ll
conquer or die!”</p>

<p>“I say, Max,” giggled irreverent Austin, “let’s tag
on to them a bit. Our shopping won’t be a scrap of
fun. We’ve just to leave an order at the timber-yard,
and call in at the ironmonger’s for nails and screws and
a few other things. Frances has disappeared into that
big draper’s, and there goes Florry after her. Let’s
get through our timber business, and then have a lark
with the girls. We’ll make the counter-Johnnies sit
up.”</p>

<p>“Won’t Frances be wild?”</p>

<p>“Not she!&mdash;come on, Max!” Away went the pair,
arm in arm, with the mincing steps they intended as
an imitation of their comrades’ sedate town manners.</p>

<p>Frances could bear a good deal, but her soul quailed
when her eyes lighted on the figures of the two boys
stealing up the shop in the wake of a frock-coated
person, of whom they had just inquired where they
should discover “the young ladies who were buying
up the establishment’s entire stock of red flannel”.</p>

<p>“We have not yet finished our business,” remarked
Austin, while he seated himself with easy grace on an
offered chair; “but we could not resist peeping in as
we passed to see how you girls were getting on.”</p>

<p>“We have not finished either,” said Frances, regarding
her brother’s demure face uneasily. “We have
bought our crimson serge and our calico, but we still
want scarlet flannel and red knitting-wool. Also
tapes, buttons, hooks, cottons, and needles.”</p>

<p>“I have bought a bradawl and a pound of French
nails,” said Austin gravely. “I am yet in need of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
yard-measure, a few miles of string, some boot-buttons,
a shaving-strop, and a packet of tin-tacks.”</p>

<p>“For my part,” said Max, “I require a lawn-mower,
a type-writer, a bottle of blacking, and a pork-pie.”</p>

<p>“With these few necessaries,” added Austin, “we
hope to complete the persecuted Johnson’s start in
housekeeping. And&mdash;Timbuctoo! I’d nearly forgotten
his wife’s mangle!”</p>

<p>“A stool and a blanket to be thrown in promiscuous,”
said Max; “and a few yards of crimson stuff
for a table-cover would be received with thanks. Ah!
and we have secured a very nice jam-pot for an ink-bottle.
Further suggestions gratefully acknowledged.”</p>

<p>“When you boys try to be funny the result is sad,”
said Frances, feeling her dignity compromised by the
mirth on the cadaverous countenance of the shop-assistant,
who had left off serving her in order to
appreciate the young gentlemen’s sallies. “Come,
Florry,” continued the ruffled damsel, “let’s try Mason’s
for the flannel: Miss Carlyon said it was good
there.”</p>

<p>The petrified assistant, seeing that the stern eyes of
a superior hard-by were fixed on him, glanced appealingly
at the boys, but Miss Morland kept sedately on
her path to the door.</p>

<p>“Won’t he get a wigging!” laughed unrepentant
Austin, following humbly in the rear. “I say, Max,
this establishment will lose the Altruist custom. I
back Mason’s for scarlet flannel!”</p>

<p>But Max was inclined to think the joke weak, and
positively refused to peril the receipts of the draper
across the road. Instead, he dragged off Austin to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
transact legitimate business; and the ironmonger had
the benefit of their wit and wisdom for the next few
minutes.</p>

<p>The girls were chattering briskly as they came out
of Mason’s.</p>

<p>“It was a splendid bargain,” declared Frances, who,
as an administrator of charity funds, had taken her
first lessons in economy. “Fifty yards of scarlet
flannel for fifty shillings! Did you see what a heap
more they had of it? The man said it was ‘a manufacturer’s
stock’.”</p>

<p>“I love manufacturers’ stocks!” ejaculated Florry.</p>

<p>“So do I, when they’re Altruist flannel,” said Frances
fervently. “Now we had better go to meet the boys
at Thorn’s. Poor boys! they have had no delicious
bargains. Perhaps it is a little dull buying nails. I
wish I hadn’t been huffy with Austin; boys hate prim,
fussy sisters. I’ll tell you what, Florry, we’ll make it
up to the poor things. We shall get first to Thorn’s,
and we’ll order all the goodies they like best. Max
prefers jam-sandwiches, and Austin likes méringues;
and they’re both fearfully fond of very plummy cake.
Thorn’s cake is capital.”</p>

<p>The girls walked on rapidly, and made, as they went,
plans for the sumptuous entertainment of the boys.</p>

<p>“We’ll heap coals of fire on their heads,” said Florry.
“They will be torn by an anguished repentance.
Here we are. Look at those lovely chocolates in the
window!”</p>

<p>“Let’s have loads of chocolates.”</p>

<p>“I like chocolate-almonds the best,” said Florry
pensively; “they are superb.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>“The boys like toffy and hardbake and Turkish-delight.
Do you know, Florry, I read in a tiresome
book that the real Turkish-delight isn’t a bit like the
English one! Wasn’t it horrid of the author to say
so? I’ve never really enjoyed it since.”</p>

<p>“It was cruel.”</p>

<p>“And both Max and Austin love Scotch shortbread.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Scotch shortbread isn’t a bit like the
English.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t,” said Frances contemptuously; “but you
can get the real thing at Thorn’s. Let’s go in. I don’t
see the boys anywhere, so we shall have time to
order a beautiful tea for them&mdash;jam-sandwiches, and
méringues, and plummy cake, and shortbread, and
toffy, and hardbake, and Turkish-delight. Oh! and
Bath-buns and gingerbread. I should like a little
bread-and-butter. The boys think it is not worth
while to have any bread-and-butter when they are
out for a lark.”</p>

<p>Frances pushed open the glass door and entered.
“Florry,” she whispered, “do make haste into the side-room
and secure the nicest table. Stay! I’ll come too;
and if we lay a few parcels down nobody will steal our
chairs. We must have the table next the window,
it’s such fun watching the carriages and people in the
street. We can come back to do our ordering.”</p>

<p>The girls advanced boldly to take by storm (if
necessary) the chosen spot.</p>

<p>“Oh! I say! What&mdash;!”</p>

<p>The most popular table in Thorn’s private tea-room
was already occupied. On two of the four chairs in
front of it sat Max and Austin, bolt upright, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
countenances wearing an expression of almost seraphic
calm. The table was covered with good things. The
girls looked, and saw jam-sandwiches, méringues, plum-cake,
shortbread, Bath-buns, gingerbread, and a little&mdash;a
very little&mdash;bread-and-butter. Glass sweetmeat
dishes contained chocolate-creams, chocolate-almonds,
toffy, hardbake, and Turkish-delight. Max mounted
guard over a laden tea-tray.</p>

<p>No sooner did they behold the astonished faces of
their comrades than the boys rose, and with their finest
company manners offered the best places to the girls.</p>

<p>“Ladies,” said Austin, “we hurried here that we
might have time to order a most beautiful tea for you.
We have done our utmost. You see before you all the
goodies you like best; and we have not even forgotten
that Frances has a weakness for bread-and-butter.”</p>

<p>“Or that Florry adores chocolate-almonds.”</p>

<p>“We wished to show you,” said Austin, “that we bear
no malice.”</p>

<p>“We wished,” said Max, “to heap coals of fire on
your heads.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The November day had drawn on to dusk before
Frances could persuade herself and the others that it
was time to start for home. The boys were despatched
to fetch the pony-carriage, and requested to call on
their way back for the biggest parcels, which would be
awaiting them at the drapers’ shops. Frances and
Florry summoned a smiling waitress, and asked her to
fill some bags with the numerous goodies left from
the feast.</p>

<p>“For the boys are sure to be hungry again before we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
reach home,” said Frances. “Snow has been falling for
the last hour; and we shall have to drive cautiously
along the country lanes, they are so dark. And poor
Rough is not properly shod for the snow yet.”</p>

<p>The girls, with their bags and parcels, were standing
ready at the door of the confectioners, and looking out
with amused and interested faces as the boys drove
up.</p>

<p>“I say,” cried Max, “it’s a good thing we brought lots
of rugs and wraps&mdash;we’re in for a storm.”</p>

<p>“Really a storm, Max?” inquired Frances, feeling
that she ought to provide prudence for the party.
“Do you think we shall get home all right with just
Rough? Oughtn’t we to leave him here and hire a
proper horse and carriage from the hotel?”</p>

<p>“It might be safer,” admitted Max, “but it would be
awfully slow.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to drive Rough,” said Austin promptly,
“come with me who will.”</p>

<p>“I will,” cried Florry, whose eyes sparkled at the
prospect of the mildest adventure.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with Frances,” said Max quietly.</p>

<p>“We’ll all go together,” decided Frances, satisfied
with her virtuous suggestion. “Max had better drive,
though; he knows the roads so well.”</p>

<p>The four packed themselves and their parcels tightly
into the trap. Rough was already tossing his head in
disgust with the rapidly-falling snow-flakes, which were
driven by a bitter north wind into his eyes and ears,
half-blinding him, and tickling him unpleasantly.
The boys had proposed that the girls should take the
front seat, because they would then have the wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
behind them; but Frances insisted on giving her place
to Austin, who was subject, when he caught cold, to a
bad kind of sore throat.</p>

<p>The snow, which in the streets of Exham partially
melted on the ground, already lay thickly on the country
roads, where it froze as it fell. The pony-carriage had
hardly turned into the narrow lanes leading in the direction
of Woodend before the youngsters found that the
storm, prophesied by Max, was on them. The snow
was hurled at their heads by a cutting blast, which
flung the heavy white flakes into deep drifts at the
sides of the roads most exposed to it. The pace had
to be very slow and the driving very careful; but
Max’s attention was lured from his duty as charioteer
when the merry talk of his companions invited him
to join their discussions. The quartette were still
warm and cosy among their rugs, and they were enjoying
the faint trace of danger which gave zest to their
adventurous journey.</p>

<p>Rough was not enjoying himself at all. The boys
had strapped a small blanket over him, but this was
not much of a protection from a winter storm. At
length he came to a full stop at the foot of a hill,
which he greatly objected to tackle with a carriage-load
behind him. The young people took the hint,
and sprang out. They were in a sheltered road, with
trees overhead; but half-way up the hill some branches,
brittle with frost, were snapped by the gale and blown
down into the lane. One of the boughs struck Frances,
another fell on Rough. Neither girl nor pony was
hurt, but both might have been.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” called out Max, “that was no joke! I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
have known serious accidents from falling branches.
We had better avoid these lanes bordered by great
trees, and choose the more open roads. You know
there are two ways to Woodend. The one by Rowdon
Common is a little further round, but it will be safer
both for Rough and for us.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll take it,” said Frances; “for though you
might get on all right without me if another bough
came in my direction, I don’t know how you would
manage without Rough.”</p>

<p>They climbed the rest of the hill, and then again
settled themselves in the trap. A little further on,
Max took the turning whence he could guide Rough
home by the longer route. And now troubles began
to descend on our Altruists. First, Rough turned
sulky, and tried to loiter, refusing to respond heartily
even when the whole quartette shouted encouragement;
because he knew very well the quickest route
to Woodend. Next, the carriage-candles began to
flicker in a manner promising speedy extinction.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” murmured Austin, when this second
fact was obvious to the party. “The stable-boy told
me the candles were very short, and wanted to put in
new ones; but I was in such a hurry, I said they
would just do.”</p>

<p>There was a chorus of reproachful groans.</p>

<p>“Suppose we put out one of the lights?” suggested
sensible Florry. “If we burn the two separately,
they’ll last longer.”</p>

<p>Even this ingenious resource did not greatly prolong
the time during which the pony and Max were
able to see their way. When the second candle failed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
him, the driver pulled up, and peered forward into
the darkness.</p>

<p>“If you could see me, my friends,” he remarked
ruefully, “you would notice that I am looking serious.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps it’s just as well that the light of
your countenance has gone out with the candles, Max,”
said Florry. “If you could see us, you would know
that we are not particularly cheerful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come!” cried Austin, “let’s keep up our spirits
somehow. What are you going to do, Max?”</p>

<p>“Lead Rough!” laughed the other boy. “I ought
to know ‘every foot of the ground’, as people say; but
it’s only when folks are out in a blinding snowstorm
on a pitch-dark evening that they discover the shakiness
of their geography. However, I know we must
soon turn to the right, and then keep on straight up
another hill to Rowdon Common. Our road borders
the Common for half a mile, and then branches off
downhill again. Once we are clear of the Common,
we shall be all right.”</p>

<p>They were not to reach that condition very easily.
Max led Rough onward, and found the necessary turning
to the right; and along the uphill road the youngsters
all walked, to lighten the pony’s burden, until
Frances took alarm on Austin’s account. After much
persuasion she induced the boy to get back into the
trap, and Florry to go with him to spare his pride.
She and Max trudged on side by side. Presently
both observed that Rough showed signs of distress.
Though close to the little animal they could hardly
see him, but they could hear his laboured breathing.</p>

<p>“Hallo! he is going rather lame,” said Max. “Surely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
he can’t have had a stone in his shoe all this time?
We’ll stop and find out.... Why! this is worse than
a stone&mdash;he has lost a shoe!”</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done now, except to let the
pony go at his own pace, and keep him to the side
of the road where the snow lay thinnest. At a very
leisurely rate the party journeyed up the remainder of
the hill, Rough stumbling badly every now and then.</p>

<p>“Here we are, at last!” sighed Max, as the road
again became level, and the increased severity of the
storm, reaching them across the high, open country,
told the travellers that they were on the edge of
Rowdon Common. “We have a rough stone wall on
one side of us now, and a pretty wide ditch on the
other; so we must jog along carefully.”</p>

<p>Max and Frances both decided to go on walking;
and Florry, after whispering persuasions to Austin,
joined them, in order to relieve Rough a little more.</p>

<p>Poor Austin’s temper suffered from his indignation
at this attempt on the girls’ part to “coddle” him.
The liveliest recollections of his latest bad throat never
sufficed to keep him out of danger if he possibly could
get into it. Max and his companions just then halted
for a moment under lee of the wall, intending to give
Rough a breathing-time; and Austin, in a fit of impatience,
seized the reins as they hung loose, and tugged
them heedlessly.</p>

<p>The culprit’s ill-temper vanished as he and the trap
and the pony swerved all together and turned clean
over into the ditch, now half-covered by a deep drift.
Frances and the others, in the better light of the open
ground, saw the rapid movement of the little carriage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
and for an instant held their breath; then peals of
laughter from Austin assured them that he was safe,
and the three rushed to the rescue.</p>

<p>Austin pulled himself out of the snow, and wriggled
from Frances’s grasp.</p>

<p>“I’m all right, Sis; don’t worry! Damp? Oh, well,
not particularly. I’m going to help Max to get Rough
on his legs. This is rough on Rough, isn’t it? Ho, ho!”</p>

<p>But Frances, who knew that her brother was something
more than “damp”, could hardly speak. Her
sufferings were far greater than the patient’s when
Austin had quinsy; and she blamed herself bitterly
for not insisting on the obviously prudent course she
had suggested in Exham. A strong carriage and sturdy
horse would long ago have conveyed the quartette
safely to Woodend; and now here they were, up on
the Common, exposed to the force of the storm, and
with no prospect of speedy escape. Austin would be
certain to take cold if his damp clothes were not soon
dried. The poor pony, after his fall and fright, would
surely be quite disabled.</p>

<p>Indeed, Rough, when again on his feet, stood shivering
and snorting, and positively refused to move
further.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’s used up,” said Max anxiously; “and
I think&mdash;really I do&mdash;that we shall be in the same
plight if we try to struggle against the storm. The
wind is a perfect hurricane up here, and freezingly
cold. Girls, I believe we had better spread our macintoshes
on the snow, roll up in our rugs, and bivouac
in the shelter of the wall. It is so low it will not
protect us unless we squat on the ground.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>The youngsters were all in agreement, and at once
set to work to carry out Max’s plan. The macintoshes
were spread, the carriage-cushions fetched to provide
seats, the parcels were ranged to act as “cover” on
the exposed side, rugs and wraps were dealt out to
everybody, and the bags of “goodies” were thankfully
seized. While Austin and the girls finished the camp,
Max laid the thick skin carriage-mat along Rough’s
back, fastened it round him with his own blanket,
and led the pony close up to the wall.</p>

<p>The buns and cakes were distributed by Frances,
who had no heart to eat, but knew that moaning over
Austin would not help him. He was wedged in
tightly between the girls, and submitted like a lamb
to be enveloped in wraps. Max took the outside place,
and fed Rough with biscuits.</p>

<p>In spite of all precautions, the little group grew
colder and damper; in spite of the most energetic
attempts at cheerfulness, their spirits sank lower.
The storm showed no signs of abating. While the
youngsters were slowly being forced to recognize that
their position was not only uncomfortable but perilous,
a strong though flickering light, as of a powerful
lantern swayed by the wind, was seen approaching
them along the road from the direction of Woodend.
The four watched it with keen eagerness. It came
nearer&mdash;came close. It was a lantern, indeed, fixed to
the front of a great hooded waggon drawn by two
powerful horses.</p>

<p>The pony-carriage still lay half in, half out of the
ditch. Max sprang to his feet and ran forward to
warn the waggoner, who, having caught sight of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
obstructions in his path, was already drawing up by
the wall. The man was known to Max as a servant
employed by a big farmer of the neighbourhood, and
the boy lost no time in shouting to the amazed driver
a cheery greeting and a peremptory demand for help
out of his own dilemma. Not many words were
needed. Job Benson recognized Max, and was quite
willing to aid him and his companions.</p>

<p>Max rushed back to the others.</p>

<p>“Hurry, Austin! Up with you, girls! Here’s relief
for the garrison at last! This waggoner is going to
Rowdon Smithy before turning across country to his
master’s farm; and he says he will take us as far as
the smithy, where we shall get safe shelter until we’ve
a chance to make our way home. We’ll tether Rough
to the waggon, and the sight of his fellow-gees will
encourage him to follow them. We must leave the
trap in the ditch till to-morrow. Now let’s make
haste, or the horses won’t stand.”</p>

<p>Rugs and shawls and bundles were grasped by the
willing hands of the rescued travellers. Into the
great waggon and its welcome shelter climbed the
girls and boys as best they could, while the good-natured
driver offered everybody a helping hand and
heartily bade the whole troop welcome.</p>

<p>“I know the old man at the smithy,” said Max to
his comrades, “and I’m sure he’ll give us a rest and a
warm. Dad’s attending him just now; nothing much
wrong but old age, you know. His name is William
East, and he has a grandson, Jim, who is no end of a
nice chap.”</p>

<p>The waggon followed a road across the Common for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
a time, and then, turning down a lane to lower ground,
touched one of the country roads to Exham. Standing
level with the road, a little back among a group
of trees, were the cottage and outbuildings of Rowdon
Smithy.</p>

<small>ROWDON SMITHY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Though the four youngsters fancied that they had
been wandering for hours in the cold and darkness,
the time of their relief was early in the evening.
Work was not yet over for somebody at the smithy.
The forge was set up in a large building, which looked
a sort of superior shed, open on the side next to the
road, and with a paved court, worn by the tread of
many horses, in front of it. Gazing across the unwalled
court to the open shed, Frances saw in the
brilliant light of the smithy fire a young man busily
engaged with hammer and anvil; his tall, slight figure,
in rough working dress, bent and raised with almost
mechanical precision as his supple right arm swung its
ponderous tool. When the lumbering waggon halted
before the court, the worker paused in his labour,
throwing back his head and screening his eyes with
his free left hand, to gain a better view of the arrival.
The waggoner called out a hasty summons, and the
young smith left his forge and quickly crossed the
yard.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong, Job?”</p>

<p>The lad’s voice was clear and soft, and his speech,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
though rustic in expression, conveyed no trace of
dialect; while his face, now plainly visible in the lantern’s
glow, appeared a singularly pleasant one. Its
attraction increased when Max’s lively countenance
was thrust forward by its owner, and when Max
shouted a gay greeting.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Jim!&mdash;Jim East! Look out for a sensation!
Here’s a snowed-up party of four humans and one
animal come to beg help and shelter!”</p>

<p>Max had jumped down and was pouring out
explanations in a moment. The young smith listened
and looked, and shyly doffed his cap, standing bare-headed
in the driving snow while his eyes rested in
astonishment on the figures of the two girls.</p>

<p>“The little ladies!” murmured Jim; “they’ve never
been with you, Master Brenton?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t they, though! They’ve found out what
a snowstorm on Rowdon Common means, I can tell
you. But I’m afraid they are very cold and tired,”
added Max seriously. “I was beginning to think it
was all up with us when I first caught sight of Job.
Well, Jim, will you help us?”</p>

<p>“Surely!” exclaimed the lad.</p>

<p>Though evidently bashful, Jim East had nothing
clownish about him. His manner showed a simple
courtesy which pleased and reassured the girl-travellers,
as he stepped close to the waggon and held up
his strong, lithe arms.</p>

<p>“Come, Missies, let me lift you down, and show you
the way to grandfather’s cottage. ’Tis but a step;
and our old Elizabeth, if she’s there, shall wait on you.
You’ll be sorely stiff with the terrible cold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>The girls willingly accepted the young smith’s offered
aid, and were placed with gentle care at Max’s
side.</p>

<p>“Young master too?” suggested Jim, seeing Austin
still above him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can get down all right,” said Austin, not too
civilly. Austin did not appear to advantage when
brought by circumstances into contact with the class
he chose to term “cads”. “Here, you chap, just catch
this baggage, will you? We’ve no end of traps. I’ll
throw them down.”</p>

<p>Frances blushed with sisterly mortification&mdash;why
would Austin be so rude and snobbish to this
worthy young artisan? Surely Jim East was a type
of those whose humble toil was the crown of honest
manhood. Certainly Austin was not a model member
of the Woodend Society of Altruists. But glancing
apprehensively at young East, lest her brother’s imperious
commands should make him surly and indignant,
Frances saw that the lad’s countenance revealed
nothing but frank good-nature. He gave Austin a
smiling reply, and would have obeyed him without
question, had not Max laid a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Not a bit, Jim! I’ll see to the baggage. Do you
get the girls under cover as quickly as you can, there’s
a good fellow.”</p>

<p>Jim turned to Frances and Florry.</p>

<p>“You’ll come with me, then, Missies? Master Brenton
knows the way.”</p>

<p>A few paces along the road a low hedge began. This
bordered a long, narrow, old-fashioned garden, cut
vertically in precise halves by a flagged pathway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
reached through a small green gate. Jim opened the
gate for the girls, and led them towards a cottage lying
back from the road at the end of the garden.</p>

<p>Frances, with Florry immediately behind her, stepped
gladly into the light and shelter of a long passage with
a door at either end. Another door, in the wall on
their right, was pushed open by the young smith, whose
dark eyes glowed with pleasure as he spoke softly to
someone within:</p>

<p>“Grandfather, here’s little ladies for you&mdash;two little
ladies! They’ve been like to have lost themselves in
the storm, so Master Brenton’s been telling me. They’ll
be best to come in here&mdash;eh, grandfather? And maybe
they’ll warm themselves with you, till I fetch Elizabeth
to wait on them.”</p>

<p>Jim stood on one side, his happy excitement controlled
by an instinctive wish to be quiet and unobtrusive
in the company of young gentlefolk. The
two girls, with ready thanks on their lips, passed by
their conductor into a fair-sized room furnished with
much homely comfort, and saw in an arm-chair by
the fire an old man, whose fine head, with its massive
forehead, keen eyes, and firm mouth, denoted strength
of will and individual character. William East’s silvery
locks were quick to command the respect of the
two girls, who stepped slowly towards their aged
host.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth has gone home, grandson,” said East,
speaking in a quavering voice which still retained a
note of decision and authority, as towards one who
had been taught prompt obedience. “So you will
wait on the little ladies yourself. Chairs to the fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
for them, Jim,&mdash;and off with their boots. Then you’ll
make some hot, strong coffee, and see you’re quick with
it. These are not the kind as needs to lose themselves
in snowstorms.” East turned his face to the girls, and
it softened wonderfully, while he addressed them in
very different tones: “Come near to the fire, Missies,
and tell me all about it. Why, you both look fairly
spent. There, there, dearies&mdash;the recklessness one sees
in young folk! But sit you down, and be sure you’re
kindly welcome.”</p>

<p>“You’re very good,” said Frances gratefully. “I
don’t know why you should be troubled with all of
us boys and girls. There are four of us, Mr. East,&mdash;and
a pony. We’ve left the carriage somewhere in
the snow. I’m afraid we’re a great bother, but you
must please try not to let us worry you;&mdash;Max Brenton
has been telling us that you aren’t very well just now,
and I’m so sorry.”</p>

<p>Frances’s sympathy was sure of appreciation&mdash;it was
so earnest and sincere, and expressed with the simplest
good-will. Old East greeted it with many nods and
smiles, and beckoned Frances to the chair nearest to
himself. Indeed, he was amazingly pleased to see this
bright young lady by his side.</p>

<p>Jim waited deftly on both the girls, taking off their
wet boots and coats, and trying to rub some feeling
back into their half-frozen feet. Next he went away
with the boots into the kitchen, and set about making
coffee in his best style.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Frances and Florry made great friends
with the ailing grandsire.</p>

<p>“I must tell you our names,” said Frances presently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
when the boys had joined the group in the cottage
parlour. “Of course you know the Doctor’s son&mdash;everybody
knows Doctor Max.”</p>

<p>“Ay, he’s his father’s son truly&mdash;I can’t say better
for him than that.”</p>

<p>“And the boy beside him is my brother Austin.
Then this is Miss Florry Fane, the best of girls; and I
am Frances Morland.”</p>

<p>The old man leaned forward suddenly, and seemed
to scan the speaker’s face with a curious intentness.</p>

<p>“Morland, did you say, my dear? Ah! once I knew
someone with that name. Does your father live here-abouts?”</p>

<p>“My father is dead. Austin and I live with our
mother in Woodend; but we have not been here long&mdash;only
since the spring.”</p>

<p>Frances talked on easily and quietly, fearing to disturb
East, who, with his face turned from her, gazed
into the fire. One hand he held across his eyes; the
other, which rested on his knee, trembled a little. For
a time he sat thus, hardly speaking, yet evidently
listening with interest and pleasure to all the young
girl cared to tell him. When she did hear his voice,
it addressed her in quavering gentleness:</p>

<p>“And you’ve come to see me, Missy,&mdash;you, so blithe
and bonnie! The Lord Himself sent you this night to
gladden my old eyes. Ah! but I’m thankful&mdash;I’m
thankful! Will you remember, little Missy, when I’m
gone hence, as your coming brought a blessing with it
to Rowdon Cottage?”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="i-058" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-058.png" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>M432</p>
<p class="center">“THE OLD MAN LEANED FORWARD SUDDENLY TO SCAN
THE SPEAKER’S FACE.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>Frances, moved by this appeal, and somewhat shy&mdash;for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
the aged face near her was quivering, and the
aged voice faltered and broke&mdash;put her small hand
trustfully on East’s wasted fingers.</p>

<p>“I am glad we came; and you are very kind.
Mayn’t I come and see you sometimes, with Max?”</p>

<p>“Rarely welcome would you be, little Missy,” said
the old man, brightening. “And there’s something
I’d say. If ever my Jim needs kindness, as like
enough he may, will you try to be good to him?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I will,” said Frances soberly, knowing
that East’s thoughts were anticipating his nearing end
and his grandson’s consequent loneliness.</p>

<p>“Jim’s one to think much of kindness from little
ladies,” continued the grandfather wistfully. “I fancy,
maybe, as I’ve not done well by him. ’Twas my wish
to bring him up strong and sturdy and independent;
for, as a wean even, the boy was gentle and soft, and
fond of daintiness. That’s why I made him a smith by
trade. Thought I, ‘He’ll learn hardness as he stands
by the forge and bends the iron to his will’. But no,
Jim’s craft will never make a man of him.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pity,” said the consoling voice of Max,
who had drawn near. “A fellow ought to match his
trade. My trade’s doctoring,&mdash;at least it’s going to
be; so I don’t miss a chance of practice. It’s not often
I get a really good thing, though. Still, all my chums
have promised that if they break an arm they’ll let
me set it.”</p>

<p>Max, with his cheery laugh, could dispel most
shadows, but East’s thoughtful gravity did not disappear.
Frances was drawn across the room by the
fragments she caught of a conversation between her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
brother and the young blacksmith, and East’s eyes
followed her and watched all her movements.</p>

<p>Jim was begging Austin to come to the kitchen and
be swathed in blankets while his clothes were drying.
Not that the working lad would have thought much
of being in a yet damper condition than was his boy-guest,
but he had heard Frances confide to his grandfather
her fears for her brother.</p>

<p>“Do now, young master, do!”</p>

<p>“Catch me!” retorted Austin, more bored than angry;
“I’m not such a soft. Clear off, I say, Jim East. I
tell you, I won’t be coddled.”</p>

<p>“Better take a bit of care than lie abed,” argued
Jim sensibly. “And Missy’s feared for you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Girls always fuss,” muttered the boy, growing
cross. He pushed aside, with unmannerly roughness,
young East’s detaining hand, and was making for the
fireside when Frances intercepted him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Austin, how can you be so rude?” whispered
the girl reproachfully. “Do go with this good-natured
lad,” she pleaded. “You know how dreadful it is
when you get a bad throat.”</p>

<p>“As though I’d loaf about his dirty old kitchen and
be rolled up in smithy blankets!” said Austin, in
extreme disgust.</p>

<p>He spoke low, but Frances knew that Jim must
hear, and she coloured deeply in her distress. Her
brother’s over-fastidiousness on some points always
made her impatient, but now she felt that he was
both foolish and ungrateful in repelling kindly advances.
She allowed Austin to pass, and throw himself
on the rug before the fire at Florry’s feet; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
she turned to Jim, again apprehensive that his feelings
might have been hurt by his guest’s unmannerly
words and ungracious bearing.</p>

<p>Jim’s eyes were on Austin; Jim’s lips smiled as,
without a touch of jealousy, he recognized in the
handsome, attractive boy the evidence of the better
training and opportunities denied to himself.</p>

<p>“Boys are always so tiresome, aren’t they?” said
Frances, seeing with relief that Jim’s face betrayed no
sense of injury. “My brother won’t be taken care of,
you see; though I’m sure if he does have a sore throat,
he won’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope he won’t be ill, Missy,” said Jim. “He
looks so&mdash;so game, and happy-like. I’d think it wasn’t
easy to coddle him.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t,” said Frances soberly; “and I don’t want
him to be a molly&mdash;only I wouldn’t like him to be ill
again. I’m ever so much obliged to you for offering
to help him.”</p>

<p>“You’ve no call to thank me, Missy. It wouldn’t
have been much to do. The pony’s safe in the shed,”
added the young smith shyly; “I’ll give him a rub
down and a feed by and by.”</p>

<p>“You are good,” said Frances. “Oh, do you think
there’s any chance of getting home to-night? All our
friends will be so anxious if we don’t return till morning,
though it’s very kind of your grandfather to say
we may camp here.”</p>

<p>“Indeed and you mustn’t worry, Missy,” said Jim.
“Sometimes there’s folks passes here much later than
this; and if you’d not mind mounting into a waggon
again&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“We wouldn’t mind a bit. I can’t think what
Mamma will do if she hears nothing about us till
morning.”</p>

<p>Jim’s young face looked very serious, but he offered no
further comfort; and Frances, feeling that her low spirits
might become infectious, tried to divert her mind by
asking leave to look at a book-case against the wall
near at hand. While she looked, and wondered a
little at the class of books she found on the shelves,
Jim fetched her a cup of hot coffee and placed it on a
small table by her side. Frances was used to the
companionship and natural attentions of well-bred
lads, but it struck her that none of her boy-friends
could have shown her more courteous respect than she
was now receiving from this pleasant young rustic.</p>

<p>“Jim,” said the voice of the old grandfather, “fetch
your fiddle, lad. Maybe the young folks might like
to hear a tune.”</p>

<p>Austin grimaced expressively behind his hands, but
only Max saw, and Max joined the girls in polite
invitations to blushing Jim. The fiddle was brought
from another room, and its owner, seating himself
modestly in a dark corner, begged to know what tune
the little ladies would like best. Florry, guessing that
the performer’s repertory might be limited, suggested
“Home, Sweet Home”.</p>

<p>Then Jim surprised his audience, for though his
rendering was entirely simple, it showed an ear for
rhythm, a taste for expression, and an unerring correctness
of pitch.</p>

<p>“He does play in tune,” murmured Austin the critic,
while the other children thanked the fiddler heartily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>Jim coloured with gratification to find himself approved,
and willingly obliged his guests with all their
favourite popular airs. By the time he had satisfied
everybody the evening had worn far on; and Jim,
yielding his fiddle into the hands of Austin, who
longed to finger the instrument of his fellow-musician,
went to hold a low-voiced consultation with his
grandfather.</p>

<p>The result of this talk was the summoning of Frances
to consider a plan of action, as proposed by the Easts.</p>

<p>“My grandson fears there’s no chance now of a way
home for you to-night, Missy. The snow is too deep
for any wise man to take a beast into without necessity.
I’m thinking ’twere best if you settled yourselves
down quiet-like, took a bit of supper, and made
the best of what I can give you. There’ll be a tidy
room upstairs for the missies, and the young masters will
sleep soundly on yonder big couch. ’Tis all I can do.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, you are very kind,” said Frances. “Of
course we shall do splendidly. It’s only because of
our friends that we mind. My mother is all alone&mdash;except
for servants,&mdash;and she will be so frightened.
Then there are Florry’s parents, and the Doctor.”</p>

<p>“You’re right to think of them, Missy,” said the old
man, whose eyes seemed to shine with a sort of solemn
joy when they rested on Frances. “And ’twould never
do to let them go in fear all night. They’d be out
scouring the country, like as not. There’s Jim will
set out for Woodend just as soon as he can get ready;
and he’ll let your friends know you’re safe and well,
and waiting here till sent for.”</p>

<p>“Jim cross the Common to-night!” cried Max,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
coming forward as spokesman for the visitors. “Oh,
I say, Mr. East! How could he?”</p>

<p>“We mustn’t let him,” said Frances. “I’m sure we
oughtn’t to.”</p>

<p>“I could go myself rather,” went on Max seriously.
“It isn’t fair that Jim should suffer for my foolery. I
ought to have backed up Frances when she wanted to
hire a trap in Exham.”</p>

<p>“That’s over and done with, master,” said East,
“and it’s no use to spend your time blaming yourself
for what was just a bit of a frolic. Jim will go, he’s
tall and strong and hardy.”</p>

<p>Frances looked at the grandson’s slight figure and
sensitive face. Jim was healthily spare and wiry, but
hardly robust. And he must be all in all to his
grandfather&mdash;the prop of the little home. Her sense
of justice made her beg hard that the venturesome
journey to Woodend might not be made; but both the
Easts, though they tried to reassure their anxious
young guests, had evidently made up their minds.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth&mdash;our old housekeeper&mdash;lives quite close
at hand,” said Jim to the girls. “I shall pass her
cottage, and I’ll bid her come to you, Missies, and see
to your comfort as well as she can.”</p>

<p>The girls insisted that they needed no waiting-woman,
but Jim smiled in respectful disagreement
while he wished them good-night. The room door
closed softly behind him, and the grandfather, pitying
the disturbed young faces, told their owners not to
fret, for Jim would surely come safely back from
Woodend, though not till long after they were a-bed
and asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>The snowstorm which had brought with it to our
youngsters so great an adventure was the talk of the
countryside for many a week. The roads about Exham
were impassable for some days, except to sturdy
rustics or stout farm-horses. Dr. Brenton came to the
smithy next day in a great waggon (just like Job
Benson’s rescuing ark), which he had borrowed from
a Woodend farmer; and with hearty thanks to the
Easts, and warm acknowledgments of Jim’s pluck and
consideration, carried off the wanderers to their homes.</p>

<p>“We should like to come again, if we may,” said
Frances, lingering by the old grandfather for a second
farewell.</p>

<p>“Ay,” he returned, pressing the girl’s kind little
hand. “I’m glad I’ve seen you, Missy. Come again.”</p>

<p>“Please!” added Jim from the background. “We’ll
be proud to have you, Missy. Come again.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>DOCTOR MAX.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The Society of the Altruists was very busy indeed.
The Christmas entertainment to which allusion
has been made was a project of Frances Morland’s,
who, among her other qualifications for the public
service, possessed the gift of diplomacy. She was
sincerely anxious to help others, and to enlist her
friends in the generous enterprise; but she knew that
the boys and girls of Woodend were no different from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
their fellows, and therefore liable to sink gradually
into a condition of lukewarmness about any scheme
which did not make a constant appeal to their active
interest. The lack of some fillip to stir up the young
people’s energies had already brought about the destruction
of numerous undertakings in Woodend which
had made a gallant start, and Frances was determined
to save her Society from such an untimely fate.</p>

<p>Everybody was pleased with the prospect of giving
an entertainment in which everybody might play
some part. The guests were to be the poor of Woodend,
and the festivity was to take place two days
before Christmas. Frances suggested this date as best
suited to the guests, who would doubtless like to
parade some, at least, of the Altruist presents at their
own home-gatherings of Christmas-day. Christmas-eve
was not a possible feast-day, because the Carlyons
liked their pupils to join in the carol-singing after the
evening service, and the service itself was one which
the young people seldom cared to miss. Then there
was so much to be done at home in the way of decorations
and private plans.</p>

<p>Therefore, many dwellers in the cottages of Woodend
were looking forward expectantly to the twenty-third
of December. Their excitement, however, was
as nothing in comparison with that of the Altruists.
Frances had made skilful division of her forces. Some
were to act in a fairy play, written for the occasion
by Florry Fane, who intended one day to astonish the
world of literature; some were painting scenery, preparing
“properties”, or making dresses for use in the
play; some were practising solos, duets, and part-songs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
for the concert which was to precede the play in the
evening’s programme. Then there were those whose
souls inclined not to literature, drama, or music: to
them fell the task of arranging the commissariat department,
and the means of distributing gifts so as to
please everyone.</p>

<p>It was Saturday evening, in the second week of
December. Up the straggling village road came,
whistling cheerily, Max Brenton,&mdash;the “man of
affairs”, as Florry had dubbed him. Max’s well-worn
coat was buttoned closely, and his crimson
comforter had been tied, with utter disregard for
appearances, over his cap, so as to shield his ears. A
bitter east wind blew about him, and as he went he
swung his arms vigorously to aid his progress, and
stamped his feet to resist the clinging snow.</p>

<p>“Hope Dad has got home,” thought the boy fervently.
“Old Carrots isn’t too lively, and this is a
regular mucky night. Ugh, what slush! Freezing
hard, too, now. I said that sudden thaw wouldn’t
hold. Well, anything’s better than slush&mdash;for us.
I’m afraid the ninety-year-olds and the babies will
suffer.”</p>

<p>The Doctor’s son trudged soberly on. He was fresh
from the playing-fields, tired, cold, and hungry for
the tea which ought to be waiting him. As he
trudged, he hoped many things. That Janet had not
forgotten to order Dad’s steak. That the dining-room
lamp would not have gone out for the third time that
week. That the fire would not have gone out to keep
the lamp company. Janet was eccentric in her dealings
with lamps and fires, and had a sort of general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
idea that Saturday was sacred to the service of the
kitchen, and not to be wasted over trifling matters
belonging to “the family’s” part of the dwelling. The
Doctor and Max had been for a dozen years “the
family” to whom Janet had consecrated her faithful
labours. She had been already old when the Doctor
had found her seated in dry-eyed despair beside the
bed of her dead husband, and had forthwith bidden
her to his home, whence the sole servant had departed
to face the wedded life just over for Janet.</p>

<p>Max had always taken Janet for granted, and had
ceased to wonder why she never mended the holes in
his stockings all at once. Janet preferred doing repairs
in instalments.</p>

<p>“For there may be a toe out here and there, and
there may not, Master Max,” she would observe; “and
small odds is it about maybe a toe. But it’s heels I
was at last mending-night, and it’s heels you’ll find
darned solid.”</p>

<p>Much anxious study of the mystery which doth
hedge a needle made Max at last independent of
Janet’s darning. Not to vex the poor old lady, he
quietly supplemented her labours with personal industry;
and when Janet did heels he did toes. Buttons
he regarded as a trifle, and even a patch&mdash;if no longer
to be avoided by care and ingenuity&mdash;was not beyond
his utmost skill.</p>

<p>Max had graver anxieties than darning. There
were, for instance, the money-box and the account-books.</p>

<p>The Doctor’s income was not to be accurately anticipated,
but its highest possible total never cost Max<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
much labour in the way of sending in bills. There
were so many “gratis” patients. Some were too poor
to pay save in thanks; some were old friends, whom
the Doctor could not endure to serve except for love
alone. When those patients who could pay remembered
to do so, the Doctor cashed their cheques and
put the change into the money-box&mdash;leaving out only
a fixed sum, which went to a fund called by Max
“Examinations”, and intended to provide for his
medical studies by and by. It was a great grief to
the Doctor, and therefore to Max, when inroads had
to be made into this fund in order to pay the tradesmen’s
weekly books. Dread of such a necessity made
the darkest hour of Saturday that which Max gave to
the family exchequer. His face always wore a portentous
solemnity when he raised the lid of the
money-box.</p>

<p>The Doctor’s home was an odd little crib standing
far back from the road at the very top of a long garden.
Alongside of the house was a one-stalled stable
and coach-house combined, with a paved square before
it and a side-door opening into a lane. Carrots, the
Doctor’s ancient steed, was of the nondescript red
colour which had suggested to Max his name, and consequently
might be seen afar off; a fact that added
greatly to his popularity with poor patients anxiously
on the look-out for the Doctor. For years the Doctor
had trudged afoot on his messages of healing; but a
small legacy from a wealthy cousin had sufficed for
the building of the stables and for the purchase of
Carrots and the trap. The Doctor had friends in
Woodend who gladly would have made him the owner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
of a thoroughbred, a brougham, and a palatial coach-house;
but there were limits beyond which a poor
man’s pride permitted not the dearest friends to go.</p>

<p>As Max neared his home he put his best foot forward&mdash;stepped
more sturdily, whistled more cheerily.
The lights he watched for had just come into view,
when he caught the sound of a child’s sobbing somewhere
in the darkness beyond.</p>

<p>“Hallo! who’s there?&mdash;Hold hard, don’t run away!
Why, Polly, it isn’t you?”</p>

<p>A very tiny, choked voice replied:</p>

<p>“’Es, Mas’r Max.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! Fancy your mother letting a mite like
you be out this weather! What are you doing, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Please, Muvver’s felled into the fire and frizzed&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>Polly repeated her news among louder sobs.</p>

<p>“And Muvver said: ‘You go find Dokker’, and I
comed.”</p>

<p>“You brave little thing!” cried Max; and, stooping,
he lifted the baby-girl into his arms. “‘Dokker’s’ out,
Polly,&mdash;at least, I’m afraid he is.” Max had missed
the light from the Doctor’s sanctum. “But come on,
and we’ll see.”</p>

<p>Max held Polly close, and ran, wondering meanwhile
what tragedy had taken place in Lumber’s Yard. The
yard was the poorest part of Woodend&mdash;a cluster of
wretched cottages, the property, like most of the village,
of Sir Arthur Fenn of Fencourt, the absentee
lord of the manor.</p>

<p>“How did Mother get hurt?” inquired Max.</p>

<p>This query drew forth a rigmarole in baby-English,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
whence, by careful reasoning and shrewd deduction,
Max gathered that Polly’s mother had rushed to the
soothing of her youngest son, aged six months, had
fallen across the wooden cradle and dropped against
the grate. Whether or not the hurts were serious, of
course the boy could not guess; but he knew the
necessity for the speedy dressing of burns, and hurried
on at his best pace.</p>

<p>To save time, Max avoided the front door, and
darted round to the back&mdash;a region where Janet
reigned supreme. The kitchen door opened right into
the yard, and at the door stood Janet, scolding Tim
the stable-boy, who ought to have been out with the
Doctor. Tim played truant occasionally&mdash;just by way
of remembering that he was a boy. At the workhouse,
where he had been brought up, he never had
attempted to be anything but elderly.</p>

<p>“Ah, Master Max,” cried Janet, “here you are, sir!&mdash;and
here’s this young vagabond come back from his
spree, which I’d make him pay dear for, if I’d my
way&mdash;but there, the master&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind Tim just now, there’s a good soul. Is
Dad back? Ah! I thought he wasn’t. Well, Janet,
just take care of Polly for a bit, will you? I’ll have
to snatch up a few things and go myself. I’m afraid
Dad has been kept somewhere, or perhaps Carrots
can’t get along. Goodness knows!”</p>

<p>Max ran through the house to the surgery, shouting
explanations while he went, while Janet packed Tim
off in disgrace to the stables, and proceeded to bestow
on Polly a share of her own tea. Presently Max came
flying back with a small bag in one hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“Keep Polly here for an hour, Janet,” the boy called
out. “I’ll be back by then, and Tim can carry her
home.”</p>

<p>But the hour passed by and Max did not return.</p>

<p>Down in Lumber’s Yard reigned a degree of excitement
which seemed keenly enjoyed by the sharers in
it. The news that Bell Baker had been burned to
death was the first rumour, but this gradually modified
itself into something approaching fact. Mrs.
Baker was a decent woman, whom a bad husband
kept in a condition of miserable poverty. It was on
behalf of her little Polly that Max, some weeks earlier,
had begged from Frances a “three-year-old frock”.</p>

<p>The entry to Lumber’s Yard was by a narrow foot-path,
and this Max found blocked up by a gesticulating
group of women. The men were congregated in the
yard itself&mdash;a three-sided court with tumble-down
cottages round it.</p>

<p>“’Ere’s Master Max!” was the general cry, as the boy
ran up the path.</p>

<p>“Out of the way, good folks,” cried Max authoritatively,
and the women parted to let him through, then
closed their ranks and followed in a body to the
Bakers’ door. This Max unceremoniously pushed
open,&mdash;and then as coolly shut and locked in the face
of the would-be busybodies. He had seen that the
one respectable neighbour Mrs. Baker possessed was
already by the poor woman’s side, and that thus he
was secure of necessary aid.</p>

<p>The boy’s manner changed when he was fairly in
possession of the place. He went across to the truckle-bed
on which the sufferer lay, and, bending over her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
asked softly if he could do anything for her relief.
The pity of the tender-hearted was in his eyes, the
skill of the expert in his hands, while he gently cut
away burned clothing and applied proper dressing to
the cruel hurts. Max had been thoroughly trained
by his father in the application of first aid to cases
of accident, and had found plenty of opportunities to
make his knowledge of practical use.</p>

<p>No more urgent need than that of Mrs. Baker had
yet presented itself to his personal care, and after a
moment’s thought he determined to take a further
responsibility on his boyish shoulders.</p>

<p>“Where’s Baker?” he asked of the friendly neighbour.</p>

<p>“No need to ask, sir. Where he allus is o’ Saturday
nights.”</p>

<p>“Well, he mustn’t be allowed to come in here unless
he’s sober. See?”</p>

<p>“Who’s to keep him out, Master Max? Baker’s a
bad sort when he’s the worse o’ liquor.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you lock the door and stand a siege?” demanded
the boy, his eyes sparkling in prospect of such
a diversion. “But no,” he added, professional prudence
conquering pugnacious instincts, “that would
worry and frighten Mrs. Baker.” Max looked down
thoughtfully on his poor patient, who lay moaning
in semi-unconsciousness. “I’ll do what I can,” he
finished, “and you will help me, won’t you, Mrs.
Lane?”</p>

<p>“Sure an’ I will, sir,” said the good woman heartily.</p>

<p>“Then stay here till my father comes. He’ll tackle
Joe Baker, if I don’t succeed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>Max paused only to speak a few words of sympathy
to Mrs. Baker, and then packed his traps and started
off.</p>

<p>At the further end of Lumber’s Yard stood a fair-sized
inn, the “Jolly Dog”, much frequented by the
lowest class of the male population. It was rented by
a man named Daniel Luss, whose license had more
than once been jeopardized by the scenes of rioting
and drunkenness his premises had witnessed. But
Luss’s landlord was Sir Arthur Fenn, and Sir Arthur’s
county influence was great. Luss willingly paid a
high rent, and the administrators of law and order
let him alone.</p>

<p>Max ran across the snow-covered yard straight to
the “Jolly Dog”. There was only one outer door. It
led to the bar, and to the inn-parlour, where the more
truculent spirits of Woodend congregated to discuss
village politics and abuse those neighbours who
struggled after respectability. Max knocked loudly
on the open door, but no one appeared. At last, taking
his courage in his hands, he stepped within. For
the time the bar was empty, its servitors being busy
in the kitchen behind, where they enjoyed black tea
and bloaters and toast to an accompaniment of unparliamentary
language from the adjacent parlour.</p>

<p>Max hesitated a minute, and his heart beat faster.
He knew that the men he was going to face were
rough and lawless&mdash;often savage and cruel. One of
the worst was Joseph Baker. But the boy recalling
the face of Baker’s suffering wife, went boldly up to
the parlour door, pushed it open and walked in.
There was no surprise for Max in the scene before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
him&mdash;groups of sodden men looming through a thick
cloud of tobacco-smoke, some already in quarrelsome
mood, some making the roof ring with mirthless
laughter. The surprise was on the side of the men,
when, a note of exclamation passing from one to the
other, they turned their heavy eyes upon the boyish
figure by the door.</p>

<p>“It’s the young Doc’,” grunted a fellow who had
entered recently, and was therefore in possession of his
faculties. “Got ’is tools with ’im too, ain’t he?”</p>

<p>There was a roar of appreciation, and the speaker
leaned back in his chair to think out another sally.</p>

<p>Max knew that what he wanted to say must be
said quickly, and, stepping forward, raised his clear
treble to a tone which he hoped might pierce the
dullest ears.</p>

<p>“Men, listen to me a moment, will you? I’ve come
to tell you something you mayn’t have heard. I’m
telling it especially to one of you&mdash;Joseph Baker.
Baker is here, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>Max had decided wisely not to heed interruptions,
but he saw a couple of hands stretched out to drag a
man from a distant corner, and guessed that the half-obscured,
tottering figure was that of Baker.</p>

<p>“Yes, there he is. Well then, Baker, and all of
you&mdash;I’m sorry to say there’s been a dreadful accident,
and Baker’s wife is badly hurt. She’s suffering fearfully,
but I think she’ll live, with care. Without care
she won’t live, and you know she has a little baby and
three other children. Now, I want Baker to promise
me he’ll do what he can to keep her quiet and comfortable
to-night, either by keeping quiet himself when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
he gets home, or else by spending the night elsewhere
and leaving his wife to Mrs. Lane’s care.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong wi’ Bell?” inquired Baker thickly
as he stumbled out from his corner. “If it’s some o’
her bloomin’ nonsense, I’ll make her pay. I’ll&mdash;”</p>

<p>Max broke in and explained clearly the manner of
the woman’s injury.</p>

<p>“So she’s gone and half-killed herself, has she?”
cried the husband savagely. “Jist let me git her, an’
I’ll finish the job. Who’s goin’ to cook my wittles,
I’d like to know, wi’ her a-shamming in bed? Here,
mates, I’m off home, but I’ll not be long. Wait till I
git back, and I’ll tell ye how I’ve settled Bell.”</p>

<p>Max looked at the wretch with scorn and loathing,
and involuntarily stretched out his arms to bar access
to the door behind him. Several of Baker’s associates
grunted applause at the husband’s valorous determination;
but the majority of the room’s occupants were
not yet in a state to be without some feeling of
humanity, and these raised a murmur of shame, of
which Max took quick advantage. It had become
evident to the boy that his visit to the “Jolly Dog”
on behalf of Bell would do more harm than good if
it sent Baker to her side while she lay unprotected.</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Max, taking the word from a stout,
good-natured looking man near to him, “it would be
a shame, wouldn’t it, not to do all one could for poor
Mrs. Baker? You know how a burn hurts, even a
little one; so you can guess how she feels now.” The
boy paused, longing for some inspiration which might
serve to delay Joe’s departure. Dr. Brenton might be
home by now&mdash;would be sure, at the earliest moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
to hasten after his son. If only Max could hinder
Baker from leaving the “Jolly Dog” until such time
as he might be pretty sure of finding his wife protected
by the Doctor’s presence!</p>

<p>“You’ve been ’elping ’er yerself, master, maybe?”
asked the stout man, pointing to Max’s bag of “tools”.</p>

<p>“I’ve tried,” said Max briefly.</p>

<p>“Then I say as you’re a rare sort for a bit of a
younker. Ain’t ’e now, mates?”</p>

<p>Max was surprised, and a little relieved, to hear a
chorus of approbation.</p>

<p>“An’ I’m blest if we don’t drink yer ’ealth wi’
three times three. ’Ere, ’Arry, set the young Doc’ in
the middle o’ the table there, an’ fill ’im a mug to
’isself.”</p>

<p>In a moment Max, lifted like a feather by ’Arry,
the giant of Woodend, found himself on the table,
and raised above the heads of the village revellers.
A foaming mug was offered to him by the stout man,
whom the others called Jack.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said the boy, taking a drink, and handing
back the mug; “I was thirsty. You’ve reminded
me that I’ve missed my tea, but it will come just as
handy later. Before I go, let’s have a lark together.
Make Baker sit down, some of you; and I’ll call on
Hal Tatton for a song.”</p>

<p>Baker was dragged back to his corner by half a
dozen hands, and the men gazed curiously at the brave,
boyish figure standing erect and masterful on the big
deal table. He was so far removed from themselves
in person, in bearing, in habit; his voice echoed with
so plucky a note, and his eyes met theirs with so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
bright an intelligence. What manner of converse
could they hold with a lad like this?</p>

<p>“Now, Hal,” called out Max imperatively, “you’re
a good hand at a lively ditty&mdash;let’s have ‘The Boys of
England’ without ado. I’ll give you your key.”</p>

<p>And Max, not entirely unappreciative of his position,
started the first verse of the latest popular melody&mdash;a
“patriotic” song, reeking of battle, and defiance, and
general jingoism. Hal caught up the air, and Max
subsided until the correct moment, when he demanded
a “jolly good chorus”.</p>

<p>The song ended, Hal retired to his seat amid loud
plaudits, and Max racked his brains for ideas. His
glance was on an old clock ticking on the mantel-shelf.
A quarter to eight! Another half-hour and he surely
might reckon safely on his father’s return home as an
accomplished fact.</p>

<p>“And then,” concluded the boy in rapid thought,
“if he hadn’t got to Baker’s cottage, I could fetch him
before Joe had done any harm. I’m sure that stout
chap would keep him here a bit if I asked him. The
thing is, to hold on a while, and then leave this lively
crew in first-rate temper.”</p>

<p>Max made the best of matters, and, following impulse,
addressed the company.</p>

<p>“That was a right good song, men, and we’re all
obliged to Hal for it. Aren’t we? Yes, that’s the way
to say ‘Thank you’. Well now, what for a change
before I go? If you like, I’ll tell you a story I read
somewhere the other day. It’s not long, and it’s no
end exciting.”</p>

<p>Max told his story accordingly; and if he were at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
first gratified by comparative silence and a fair amount
of attention from his rough audience, he was none the
less aware of a beating heart as he approached his
climax. For Max’s tale was a true one, and its chief
incident&mdash;exciting, as he had promised&mdash;was the rescue
of an injured wife from her husband’s brutality by a
band of chivalrous and pitiful rustics. Max almost
held his breath as he concluded. He had played for
high stakes, and might have lost everything.</p>

<p>When the boy’s voice ceased, there was absolute
silence; his hearers had been following him closely.
Suddenly Baker started from his corner with a savage
growl.</p>

<p>“’E’s lettin’ on at me, that’s wot ’e is! Do you ’ear
me, I say? ’E’s told that ’ere story agin me; and
’anged if I don’t take it out o’ ’im instead o’ Bell!
No! I’ll git ’im first, an’ Bell arter!”</p>

<p>Baker threw himself furiously towards the table,
where Max stood, quiet and watchful. He knew that
he would be helpless in Joe’s clutches, if no one took
his part.</p>

<p>Then Harry uprose, and stepped carelessly to Baker,
whom he cast to the floor with one well-directed
push.</p>

<p>“You’re a plucked ’un,” said the giant, surveying
Max grimly; “an’ look ’ere, you’re a proper Doc’ an’
you’ve arned your pay. My mates an’ me”&mdash;Harry
glanced rapidly round&mdash;“we’ll keep that tale o’ yourn
in our ’eads to-night. We’ll take turns to watch Bell’s
door, and&mdash;my word on’t,”&mdash;he thumped his great
fist on the table,&mdash;“that skunk Joe sha’n’t set ’is foot
inside till you give ’im leave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>A roar of confirmation from Harry’s mates set
Max’s mind at rest.</p>

<p>“Ah, thank you, Harry!” said Max in real gratitude;
“I thought you’d want to help poor Mrs. Baker.
And thank you all,” added the boy merrily, “for being
so kind to me. We had a jolly song, hadn’t we? I
shall call on Hal Tatton for another next time I see him.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get it so soon as ye asks, master,” returned
the grinning Tatton. “I’m not forgetting the way ye
cured that sprained wrist o’ mine&mdash;I’ll stand by Bell.”</p>

<p>“And me!” “And me!” shouted the voices of many
rough fellows who had met with kindness from the
good Doctor or his son.</p>

<p>“Then thank you all again, and good-bye!” cried
Max. The men stood silent, watching him as he went.
He had brought with him into the wretched place a
glimpse of brightness, and the loafers of Lumber’s
Yard were sorry to see him go.</p>

<p>Harry the giant kept his word, and told off his
retainers to mount guard by turns over the cottage
where Bell lay moaning. By and by he found it
simpler to lock Joe Baker into a shed behind his
cottage, giving him plenty of sacks to keep him warm,
and a liberal supply of food, collected from the neighbours.
In this fashion Joe was kept out of mischief
until Bell was up and about again; when Harry’s
elementary sense of justice assured him that he had
kept his bond with Max and had no further right to
interfere for the present in the marital affairs of the
Bakers.</p>

<p>During the long hours of his imprisonment, Joe’s
memory of Max’s successful plan stirred the drunken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
scamp to bitter hatred and a passionate desire for
revenge. But he knew that to raise a finger against
“the young Doc’” would be to set the whole village
in a fury; and dread for the results on his own person
made him sulk and scowl in secret.</p>

<p>Max, on that eventful evening, went from the
“Jolly Dog” straight back to the Bakers’ cottage.
There, as he had hoped, he found his father, and the
pair walked home in company.</p>

<p>First, the Doctor bestowed a little judicious professional
praise on his son’s surgical handiwork, and
made a few comments for Max’s future guidance.
Next, he turned to a fresh topic&mdash;one which, as might
easily be seen, was at the time very seriously in his
thoughts.</p>

<p>“I have been to Rowdon to-night, Max.”</p>

<p>“To the smithy, Dad?” asked Max, glancing up
quickly. “Is old East any better?”</p>

<p>“He never could have been better,” said the Doctor
quietly; “now he never will be worse. I was in time,
Max, to see the end. It was very peaceful&mdash;just the
sleep of old age. There was really no disease. Nature
had worn herself out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dad! Poor Jim! Is he all alone?”</p>

<p>“He has his old servant Elizabeth and her crippled
husband. But the lad’s sensitiveness shrinks instinctively
from the sort of condolence people of that class
usually offer. You know what I mean, Max,” continued
Dr. Brenton hastily. “I don’t mean that the
sorrow or the sympathy of poor folks is less real than
that of their betters as the world counts degree. But
they have different modes of expression&mdash;and&mdash;well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
Jim is not of Elizabeth’s order. I wondered why,
until to-night. Old East, before he died, solved the
mystery for me.”</p>

<p>“How, Dad?” asked Max in surprise.</p>

<p>“You’ll know some day, sonny. I may tell you
only that East didn’t want me to-night as a medicine
man. He knew I could do nothing for him. Now,
Max, I should like you to go to the smithy early to-morrow,
and see what you can do for Jim.”</p>

<p>“I will, of course, Dad.”</p>

<p>“Take him out for a walk&mdash;encourage him to speak
his heart to you. ’Twill do him good&mdash;poor boy!
poor boy! I see trials in store for Jim.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Frances might go with me? She’s the
best sympathizer I know of. And she liked old East,
and has seen him several times since the night we
lost ourselves in the snow. Couldn’t I tell her?”</p>

<p>“Her mother would not let her go, Max,” interrupted
the Doctor; “I’m quite sure of it. And perhaps,
for many reasons, it’s better she shouldn’t. But
by all means tell her of Jim’s loss. Later on it may
be her lot to console him. Meanwhile, we blundering
males can but do our best.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>MUSIC AND MUMMING.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was December the twenty-third, and two o’clock
in the afternoon. Frances and Austin had finished
their early dinner at their mother’s luncheon-table,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
and were hurrying down the road to the school-house,
where, by grace of the Rector, the Altruists’ entertainment
was to be given.</p>

<p>“We still have plenty to do,” exclaimed Frances a
little breathlessly, for the brother and sister were
walking at a rapid pace. “The benches have to be
arranged, and the tables laid, and I have one more wig
to make for the ‘Ten Little Niggers’.”</p>

<p>“Gramercy!” exclaimed Austin; “did I not count
ten heads, and ten wigs on the heads, at the dress
rehearsal yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Teddy’s was not a proper wig,” sighed Frances.
“You know Teddy has not a mother&mdash;or even an
aunt, or a cousin, or an old nurse&mdash;to do anything of
that sort for him. His father’s housekeeper is a
horrid cross old thing, who would not have let Teddy
act at all if she could have helped it. So I waylaid
Mr. Bevers, and made him promise that Teddy should
do anything I liked; and then Florry and I saw to his
dresses between us. That is how Teddy comes to be
a little nigger, and a baker-boy, and a fairy-page. He
is such a darling, and he sings like a cherub. We
wanted him ever so badly.”</p>

<p>“Girls always contrive to get what they want.
They just peg away till they do. I will say, though,
Frances, that they don’t mind going to any amount of
trouble about it. Fancy making three dresses for one
little shaver!”</p>

<p>“The baker-boy dress isn’t much&mdash;just a cap and
apron,&mdash;and the little nigger was easy. The pink satin
fairy-page was different, of course. Teddy and Gus,
in pink and blue, look sweet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“They are rather fetching,” condescended Austin.
“And Max’s idea of letting Teddy and Lilla sing the
opening duet was a jolly good one. I’m not gone on
babies, but Lilla’s a picture in that old-world thing
her mother has dressed her up in.”</p>

<p>“She’s a picture as a fairy too,” said Frances;
“though I think the minuet will be the most picturesque
bit of the play. Florry is a lovely fairy god-mother,
isn’t she? I do think she’s clever enough to
act at the Lyceum!”</p>

<p>“The play’s the thing, undoubtedly, as Mr. Hamlet
of Denmark remarked. Just wait till you see our
Travesty, though. I flatter myself we’ll make Woodendites
sit up. Max and I have worked out a splendid
blood-curdling duel, with that drop-lunge Mr. Carlyon
taught us for a finish. You didn’t see it at rehearsal
yesterday?”</p>

<p>“No, I was called away; but I’m sure it will be
capital. Max is funny, as <i>Laertes</i>. And Frank Temple
is a fine <i>King</i>. How lucky it is he had that lovely
dress of red velvet and ermine!”</p>

<p>“It is a real stage-dress. Frank had an uncle who
went on the stage and became a famous actor. The
regal robes belonged to him.”</p>

<p>“Fancy! That is interesting. I wonder what he
would say if he knew they were going to be worn in
the Hamlet Travesty.”</p>

<p>“He’d think it jolly cheek.”</p>

<p>“We never could have done the Travesty without
Mr. Carlyon. Of course, it was his plan that we should
act it; so I suppose that’s why he has been so much
interested in it. And Miss Carlyon has stage-managed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
Florry’s play for us: she said it was her duty as president
of the Altruists.&mdash;There’s Betty Turner, Austin.
Make haste, and we’ll catch her up.”</p>

<p>The active pair soon caught up Betty, who was
exceedingly plump, and was never seen in a hurry.
She looked at her friends in mild amazement as they
pelted down the hill and pulled up one on each side
of her.</p>

<p>“How you two do excite yourselves!” she observed
languidly. “Francy’s cheeks are as red as beet-root,
and Austin will have no breath left for his song.”</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t enjoy anything if we didn’t get
enthusiastic!” laughed Frances. “And isn’t this the
great occasion&mdash;the Altruists’ field-day?”</p>

<p>“I shall have to leave the club, you make me so
hot!” chuckled Betty. “I feel like building a snow-man
when I look at you. At least, somebody else
might build him for me, while I watched. The sensation
would be equally cooling.”</p>

<p>“And not nearly so fatiguing,” said Austin. “Won’t
you enjoy filling a hundred tea-cups twice over, Betty?”</p>

<p>“Catch me, indeed! I sha’n’t do the pouring out&mdash;that’s
for May and Violet. They like it. Especially
May. She has a genius for mathematics, and will be
able to solve the problem of how many spoonfuls of
tea to the pot, and how many pots to the tea-tableful
of old women.”</p>

<p>“Give ’em plenty,” urged Austin. “Tibby Prout
told me she hadn’t tasted tea this winter.”</p>

<p>“Tibby Prout!” repeated Betty meditatively. “I’ll
keep my eye on Tibby: she shall have six cups. Just
write her name here, Austin.” Betty pulled a notebook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
and pencil from her pocket. “It is so tiring to
remember names.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to remember to look in your notebook;
and then you’ll have to remember why the name
of Tibby Prout is written there; and then you’ll have
to remember why I, and not you, have written it.”</p>

<p>“So I shall!” agreed Betty mournfully; and with
an air of great depression she turned in at the school-house
gate.</p>

<p>“‘A plump and pleasing person’,” whispered Austin
mischievously in his sister’s ear. “It’s a good thing
she’s amiable, as there’s so much of her!”</p>

<p>The boy ran off, laughing, to greet Max, who was
just coming up to the gate. In his company came
“Harry” the giant, a broad grin on his stolid face.</p>

<p>“See whom I’ve brought!” exclaimed Max, when
greetings and confidences had passed between the
chums. “You needn’t worry any longer about the
benches, Frances. Harry has promised to arrange
them all, just as you like.”</p>

<p>“That is kind of you, Harry,” said the girl, looking
at the rustic with the frank kindliness which acted
like a charm on her poorer neighbours, and made them
her faithful allies. “I just wanted somebody very
strong and rather patient. It will take a good while
to move the benches, but it would have taken the
boys twice as long as it will take you.”</p>

<p>“Never fear, Miss,” said the giant heartily; “I’ll turn
this ’ere place upside-down in ’arf an hour, if so be as
you want it.”</p>

<p>Then they all set busily to work. The school-house
contained one large room, of which the upper part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
possessed a platform which was used for all sorts of
village entertainments, such as penny-readings and
magic-lantern shows. The young Altruist carpenters
had rigged-up a plain screen of wood above and at
the sides of the platform, and this, when hung with
drapery, took the place of a proscenium, and was fitted
with a curtain which would draw up and down.
There were two entrances, right and left of the stage,
and simple appliances to hold the simple scenery.
Not much scope was given, perhaps, for elaborate
effects; but Miss Carlyon as stage-manager, and
Florry as dramatist, had used their wits, and some of
their contrivances were wonderfully ingenious. They
had availed themselves, too, of such opportunities as
were offered by the command of a passage running
from one stage-door to the other, outside the room.
Here they marshalled their processions, and assembled
their hidden choir, and even found room for one or
two members of the orchestra when these were wanted
to discourse music at moving moments of the performances.</p>

<p>Owing to the length of the programme, the proceedings
were to begin at four o’clock, with a generous
tea. Before the hour arrived the Carlyons made their
appearance, and were immediately in the thick of
everything. Edward, his long coat flying behind him,
dashed hither and thither in response to agonized calls
from boys in difficulties; while Muriel gave helping
hands to her girls, until the preparations for tea were
complete.</p>

<p>Every Altruist wore a crimson badge, and a similar
one was presented to every guest on entrance. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
stage-hangings were crimson; the Christmas greetings
hung up on the walls were fashioned in crimson letters
on a white ground. Of course the room was prettily
decorated with green-stuffs and berries, and the long
tables grouped in the background were ornamented
with lovely flowers. Altogether, the aspect of the
room was distinctly festive when, as the clock struck
four, the doors were thrown open and the guests began
to pour in. Men, women, and children&mdash;all had been
invited; and for once the denizens of Lumber’s Yard
mingled with the better-class cottagers. Bell Baker,
still pale, and poorly-clad, was brought under the care
of the Doctor himself, who had borrowed a bath-chair,
and packed his suffering charge into it. With Bell
came her three eldest children; the baby was being
cared for by an enterprising cottage-woman, who had
decided to stay at home from the Altruist Feast and
“take in” babies at a penny the head! The resulting
fortune in shillings was a satisfactory consolation to
her for the loss of her treat.</p>

<p>The Altruist fund might have fallen short of the
demands made on it for the expenses of the grand
entertainment, had it not been amply supplemented
by those well-to-do inhabitants of Woodend who were
interested in the undertaking. The feasts proper&mdash;both
tea and supper&mdash;were “entirely provided by
voluntary contributions”, as Frances had proudly
announced at the last meeting of the Society. The
rector offered fifty pounds of beef; Miss Carlyon’s
cookery-class made a score of plum-puddings and a
hundred mince-pies, the materials coming from the
kitchens of Altruists’ mothers; the oranges and apples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
and almonds and raisins, with such trifles as bon-bons
and sweets, were sent in by various Altruists’ fathers.
Mrs. Morland promised fifty pounds of cake, and as
Austin was allowed to do the ordering it was as
plummy as Christmas cake knows how to be. In this
way gifts rapidly mounted up; and by the time it
became necessary to reckon up the funds, Frances
found that she had only sugar to provide!</p>

<p>This was very cheering to the young leader of the
Altruists, who had dreaded having to check the bounding
ambition of her associates. The sewing-meetings
had done great things with scarlet flannel and crimson
wool; but in this direction, also, the grown-ups were
kind. Mrs. Morland, who had quietly assumed the
headship of Woodend society, dropped polite hints at
dinner-parties and distributed confidences at “At
Homes”. It became generally understood that all
contributions of new and useful clothing would be
thankfully received in the club-room. Perhaps Mrs.
Morland’s patronage did less for the cause than did
the popularity of her daughter. Frances was everybody’s
favourite; and the pleasure of receiving her
earnest thanks, and seeing the joyful light in her grave
gray eyes, sent many a Woodend matron and maid to
the making of shirts.</p>

<p>The Carlyons had determined privately to run no
risk of usurping the credit which belonged of right to
the originators of the entertainment; and they kept
very much behind the scenes during the evening,
except when sharing the labours of the party told off
to preserve order and see that all the guests were comfortably
placed. Tea over, and the tables cleared, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
orchestra struck up a lively medley of popular tunes,
while the company were ranged on the benches that
Harry had set in two rows, facing the stage, in the
upper part of the long room. Behind these benches
was a small space, and then a few rows of chairs
for the families and friends of the Altruists, who were
to be permitted to view the performances in consideration
of their liberal help.</p>

<p>When all were seated, and quiet reigned in the
neighbourhood of the empty tea-tables, the orchestra
ceased to make melody, and Miss Carlyon, slipping
round from the back, took her place before the piano,
the fifteen-year-old Pianist of the band retiring modestly
to a three-legged stool that she shared with the
fourteen-year-old First Violin. The footlights were
turned up, the gas in the auditorium was turned
down; on the whole audience fell the hush of expectancy.
Miss Carlyon played a few bars of a simple
children’s song; then the curtain swayed backward
a little to allow two performers to step before it.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="i-091" style="max-width: 28em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>M432</p>
<p class="center">“A STORY WE BRING YOU FROM FAËRY LAND.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>First came Teddy Bevers, beautiful to behold in his
pink satin tunic trimmed with swansdown, lace ruffles,
pink silk stockings, and buckled shoes. His dark
curls bobbed merrily all over his little head, as, holding
his pink hat with its white plume behind him, he
bowed low to another small figure tripping after him.
Lilla Turner was a tiny, slender maiden, just the
opposite of plump Betty, her sister and slave; she
wore a short petticoat of quilted white satin, and a
Watteau bodice and panier of white and gold brocade.
Lilla returned Teddy’s bow with a sweeping curtsey,
then took his offered hand, and the little pair paced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>solemnly to the front and made a profound salute to
the audience. Both sang prettily; and Miss Carlyon’s
careful teaching had given them a clear enunciation,
which made the words of their prologue audible
throughout the room:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A story we bring you from Faëry Land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A story of gallant, and maiden, and sprite;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we ask you to lend us a favouring hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">While we tell it, and sing it, and act it to-night.</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">List, list to our story of maiden and fay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Of prince, knight, and peasant; oh, listen, we pray!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Teddy and Lilla continued, through three verses, to
entreat the indulgence of an audience already disposed
to be more than kind; then the salutes were sedately
repeated, and the little couple vanished amid enraptured
applause. The beauty and grace of the small actors
had warmed the hearts of the workaday folk to whom
they sang, and the Woodend villagers demanded an
encore with all their hands and tongues.</p>

<p>The programme was long enough already; and,
besides, Florry’s sense of dramatic fitness made her
look on a repetition of her prologue as something like
barbarism. So Teddy and Lilla were told to go on
again and bow their acknowledgments; which they
did, kissing their hands ere they finally retired.</p>

<p>They had paved the way admirably for the others,
and the fairy play was throughout a brilliant success.
The curtain was rung down on a most picturesque
tableau, while Max burned red fire at the wings, and
the orchestra discoursed sweet music. Three times the
curtain was raised before the audience would be satisfied;
and even then there were calls for the “author”,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
and Florry was pulled on to the stage by a group of
enthusiastic little fairies.</p>

<p>A big sigh of satisfaction seemed to come from
everybody; and the onlookers were still assuring each
other that nothing could beat the fairy play, when the
orchestra struck up a familiar melody. All the boys
on the benches began to hum appreciatively; and the
curtain slowly rose, while across the stage in a couple
of bounds sprang the First Little Nigger. His age was
twelve, his face and hands were sooty-black; he wore
a costume of scarlet-and-white striped cotton jacket,
green knickerbockers, one scarlet and one white stocking,
a white collar of enormous proportions, and a lovely
horse-hair wig. After him came his nine brothers, in
similar raiment, and in gradations of size, which ended
in Teddy Bevers, who informed his hearers that he was
the “Tenth Little Nigger Boy!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carlyon had written a new version of the historic
ditty&mdash;a version strictly topical, and full of harmless
local allusions, which won peals of laughter from the
benches. The actors had been taught some amusing
by-play; and their antics drew shrieks of delight from
small boys and girls, who had gaped in uncomprehending
wonderment at the Fairy Godmother. It was of
no use to try to refuse an encore for the Ten Little Niggers,
so Mr. Carlyon sent them on again to repeat their
fun and frolic for the benefit of the little ones in front.</p>

<p>The niggers had brought the younger portion of the
audience into such an uproarious condition that the
feelings of the First Violin were sadly tried by the hubbub
amid which she stepped on to the platform. But
now, if ever, Woodend was on its good behaviour; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
as the elders wanted to “hear the music”, they coaxed
and scolded the juniors into a restless silence. However,
the melting strains of Raff’s “Cavatina” were not
beyond the appreciation of anybody; and those who
did not admire her plaintive performance for its own
sake, were full of wonder at the skill of the First Violin.
The next item on the programme was a vocal duet by
Frances and her brother. Austin sang well in a
charmingly fresh treble, with which his sister’s alto
blended very prettily; and the pair had practised most
conscientiously. This was the only number of the
programme in which Frances’s name appeared. The
girl had declined to be put down for anything which
would give her prominence, because she knew her
mother would prefer to see Austin to the fore, and
Frances had a delicate instinct which warned her not
to court jealousy by claiming too much for the Morland
family. Austin had played one of the best parts
in the fairy piece, was to play <i>Hamlet</i> in some scenes
selected by Mr. Carlyon from Poole’s “Travesty”, and
besides his duet with Frances, had a solo to sing. Nobody
grudged the bright, good-natured boy his many
appearances, but Frances felt that they ought to suffice
for both.</p>

<p>The concert swung gaily on its way. The First Little
Nigger, still sooty of face and brilliant of attire, sang
<i>Hard times come again no more</i> to his own banjo
accompaniment, and was rewarded by the sight of
many pocket-handkerchiefs surreptitiously drawn
forth. There was a flute solo from Guy Gordon, a
musician whose fancy usually hovered between the
jew’s-harp and the concertina; but on this occasion he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
gave a “Romance” for his more classical instrument,
and moved to emulation every rustic owner of a penny
whistle. Three little lads, dressed as sailor-boys, were
immensely popular in a nautical ditty, which cast a
general defiance at everybody who might presume to
dispute the sovereignty of <i>The Mistress of the Sea</i>;
and three little girls with three little brooms joined in
a <i>Housemaid’s Complaint</i>, which set forth in touching
terms the sufferings of domestics who were compelled
to be up by ten, and to dine on cold mutton and
fried potatoes. Songs, humorous and pathetic, filled
up the concert programme, until it terminated in a
costume chorus, <i>How to make a Cake</i>.</p>

<p>This item was an exemplification of the picturesque
possibilities of familiar things. A table in
the middle of the stage was presided over by Betty,
attired in print frock, cap, and apron. In front of
her on the table stood a big basin. To her entered
a train of boy and girl cooks, carrying aloft bags
and plates containing materials for cake-making. A
lively song, descriptive of the action, accompanied
Betty’s demonstration of the results of her cookery
studies; the cake was mixed, kneaded, disposed of
in a tin, and proudly borne off to an imaginary
stove by Guy Gordon, the biggest baker. The song
continued, descriptive of the delightful anticipations
of the cake-makers; and when Guy returned carrying
a huge plum-cake, this was promptly cut into
slices by Betty and distributed among her helpers,
who, munching under difficulties, marched round the
stage to a triumphant chorus of “<i>We’ll show you how
to eat it!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>Max was to appear as <i>Laertes</i> in the Travesty, and
had hitherto taken no more distinguished part in the
entertainment than the playing of what it pleased him
to call “twentieth fiddle” in the orchestra. But he
now found greatness thrust upon him. No sooner
had the cooks acknowledged their call and vanished,
than Harry the giant uprose in his place, and boldly
addressed Mr. Carlyon.</p>

<p>“Axing parding, sir, if I may make so bold, there’s
some of us ’ere&mdash;me and my mates&mdash;wot knows as
’ow the young Doc’ can sing a rare good song. And
we takes the liberty of askin’ Master Max to favour
us.”</p>

<p>Harry’s speech created an immediate sensation; but
his sentiments were upheld by prolonged applause from
his “mates” and the audience generally.</p>

<p>Edward Carlyon successfully maintained a strict
impartiality in his dealings with his pupils; but in
his heart of hearts he kept a special corner for Max
Brenton. Well pleased with Harry’s request, he leant
towards the “twentieth fiddle”, and said:</p>

<p>“You hear, Max? You’re honoured by a distinct
invitation; so up with you to the platform and let’s
hear what you can do!”</p>

<p>Max, covered with blushes, was pushed forward by
the entire orchestra, while Carlyon seated himself in
front of the piano.</p>

<p>“What shall it be, lad?&mdash;<i>The Old Brigade</i>, I think.
Muriel, will you tell the boys and girls behind to provide
Max with a chorus?”</p>

<p>Max plucked up courage, and obeyed. His slight
figure, in its trim Eton suit, stood out bravely on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
platform, reminding Harry and one or two others of
another evening when the boy had sung “against
time” to save a woman from suffering.</p>

<p>All the Altruists knew <i>The Old Brigade</i>, and had
chimed in with a chorus many a time when the Carlyons’
young choristers had held their merry practices
in the boys’ school-room. So the gallant song went
with splendid spirit, and when it reached its last verse
the chorus was reinforced by the greater number of
the audience, who proceeded rapturously to encore
themselves.</p>

<p>Max’s song was an excellent finish to the concert;
and then the onlookers were allowed a few minutes to
recover their breath and discuss the performance, while
the stage was made ready for the Travesty.</p>

<p>In front reigned mirth, satisfaction, and pleasing
hopes of more good things to come. Behind, the aspect
of affairs had changed suddenly. At the end of Max’s
song a letter was handed to Carlyon, whose face, as
he read, became a proclamation of disaster. He was
in the little room at the end of the passage, which had
been made ready for the use of the performers when
off the platform; and round him had gathered the boys
and girls who were to figure in the Travesty.</p>

<p>“Bad news, youngsters,” said Carlyon dismally.
“The first hitch in our evening’s entertainment. I
wondered why Frank Temple was so late in arriving.
This letter&mdash;which evidently ought to have reached
me before&mdash;is to tell me that Mr. and Mrs. Temple
have been summoned by telegram to Mr. Temple’s
home, where his father is lying dangerously ill. The
boy was named in the telegram&mdash;his grandfather had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
asked for him; so of course he has gone with his
parents. Now,” continued Carlyon, looking at the
blank faces before him, “I know that all of you will
feel very much for Frank; but just at present we
must think also of the poor folk in the school-room,
who are waiting patiently for your appearance. What
shall we do? Shall we give up the Travesty? Or
will someone go on and read the part of the <i>King</i>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t stop the play! Let’s act!” cried some.</p>

<p>“Max and Austin’s fencing-match is so funny!” cried
others.</p>

<p>“Well, I think myself we ought to proceed, and do
our best. The question is, who can read the <i>King</i>?
It must be someone who knows something about the
piece&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Frances!” exclaimed Max immediately. “Frances
has been at all the rehearsals; and she has often read
the <i>King’s</i> part when she was hearing Austin and me
say ours!”</p>

<p>Frances at first held back; but when she saw that
she was really the best person to fill the breach, she
made no more ado, but began to look about for a
costume.</p>

<p>“If only Frank had thought of sending his,” said
Max, regretful of the crimson velvet and ermine. “It
would have done quite nicely for Frances. The tunic
would have covered her frock.”</p>

<p>“We can hardly borrow it without leave, though.
Well, I must let you settle the knotty point of costume
for yourselves, youngsters, while I help my sister with
the stage.”</p>

<p>Carlyon rushed off, nodding encouragingly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
Frances, who had her eyes on the play-book and
on every corner of the room in turn. Suddenly she
darted over to a table covered by a crimson cloth.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” she cried. “Here’s my tunic. A little
ingenuity will soon drape it gracefully about my
kingly person.”</p>

<p>Frances had seized the table-cover; and now, amid
peals of laughter, she began, with Austin’s assistance,
to pin herself into it. Max vanished from the room,
returning in three minutes with two articles borrowed
from friends among the Altruists’ relations in the
audience.</p>

<p>“See, Frances! This fur-lined cape will make you
a lovely cloak, and this fur tippet, put on back to
front, will be your regal collar. About your neck and
waist we will dispose the fairy prince’s gold chains,
and he shall lend you his sword, likewise his cap.”</p>

<p>“Not his cap,” amended Austin, who was dancing a
triumphant jig round his sister. “Frank left his crown
here yesterday after rehearsal, and Frances can wear
that.”</p>

<p>“And her sleeves will look all right. What a good
thing your frock is of black velvet, Frances!”</p>

<p>By the time the young costumiers had finished they
had turned out quite an effective <i>King</i>. Frances’s
dark hair, waving to her shoulders, was pronounced
“a first-rate wig” when the regal crown had been
fitted on. The Carlyons declared the new <i>King</i> to
be admirably attired; and Frances, relieved of anxiety
about her costume, entered fully into the fun.</p>

<p>“I’m a ‘king of shreds and patches’ like Shakespeare’s
man,” she chuckled; “but so long as my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
various garments hold together, I don’t mind! Max,
if I could get a few minutes to look through this
long speech, I believe I could manage without the
book. I’ve heard Frank say his part ever so often.”</p>

<p>“You’ve helped everybody, Frances,” said Max, remembering
gratefully his own indebtedness, “and now
you’re going to shine yourself. You’ll have time to
read up your part before you go on.”</p>

<p>The spirit of true burlesque is rare among amateurs;
but youngsters who act for the fun of the thing, and
not merely to “show off”, are often capable of excellent
comedy. Carlyon had chosen with care the boys and
girls who were to perform in the Travesty, and had
trained them sufficiently but not too much. Entering
completely into the humour of parody, one and all
acted with plenty of vigour and without a trace of
self-consciousness. Max and Austin had arranged a
serio-comic fencing-match, which was brought to a
melodramatic finish by a clever rapier trick. Frances’s
play with the poisoned cup sent Betty, the lackadaisical
<i>Queen</i>, into a series of private giggles, which she was
compelled to conceal by an unexpectedly rapid demise.
At last the curtain rang down on Austin’s farewell
speech.</p>

<p>The boys and girls who during the long evening had
figured on the platform assembled in the green-room
for a brief chatter over their experiences. They were
in high spirits and honestly happy; for they felt that
they had done their best, and that their best had
given several bright and pleasant hours to folks whose
lives were but dull and gray.</p>

<p>Buns, sandwiches, and lemonade provided the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
Altruists’ modest refreshment. They had thoroughly
earned their supper, but they hurried through it in
order to make an appearance at the feast-tables of
their guests. There was neither time nor place for
change of dress; so the actors in their motley garb
now mingled with their audience, greatly to the
latter’s delight. Sweets and bon-bons tasted twice as
good when handed round by Teddy in pink satin,
and Lilla in white; and a whole troop of little fairies
dispensed almonds and raisins at a lavish rate. The
movement of the guests to the supper-tables at the end
of the room was the signal for the retirement of upper-class
Woodend to the neighbourhood of the platform,
whence it watched its young people justifying their
motto, “Help Others”.</p>

<p>“Austin,” whispered Frances, “aren’t you sorry poor
Jim isn’t here?”</p>

<p>“Jim?” questioned her brother. “Why, wouldn’t he
have been a cut above these good folk?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course. He wouldn’t need anyone to
give him supper or a woollen comforter, I suppose.
But he could have seen the acting, and he would have
helped us.”</p>

<p>“Really, Frances, you are ridiculous. You have such
a fancy for Jim&mdash;as though we could have had a fellow
like that tagging on to us all the evening.”</p>

<p>“I could have put up with him very well,” returned
Frances calmly; “and he would have been very useful.
Don’t <i>you</i> be ridiculous, Austin.”</p>

<p>Austin muttered something about not wanting “loafing
cads” in his vicinity; and was called so severely to
task for his unmannerly epithet that he retired to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
grumble mildly in Max’s ear. But Max, too, liked
Jim, and regretted the lad’s absence and the cause of
it. He was sure that Frances was thinking pitifully
of Jim’s lonely Christmas, and his sympathy was with
Frances, not with her brother. Austin saw that his
grumble must seek another sympathizer, and while
looking for one, he noticed an old man’s empty plate,
and flew to fulfil the duty of an Altruist host.</p>

<p>Supper was followed by a distribution of gifts. The
presents numbered two for each person, and the ambition
of the society had decreed that they should be
strictly useful and of a kind to give some real comfort
to the recipients. Thus, flannel shirts, knitted vests
and socks, and cardigan jackets were handed to the
men; while the women received warm skirts, bodices,
and petticoats, “overall” aprons, and woollen shawls.
Crimson was the hue of most of the clothing, and
Max’s prophecy concerning the Altruist village seemed
on the way to fulfilment. Thanks came heartily and
in full measure from the delighted guests; and when
their best spokesman had been put forward to offer
the gratitude of the poor of Woodend to “the young
ladies and gentlemen what had shown them a kindness
they’d never forget”, good-byes became general, the
village-folk trooped out, and the happy evening was
really over.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Morland went home alone in her carriage,
promising to send it back for Frances and Austin, who
were to take Max with them and set him down at his
father’s gate. A wonderful amount of consideration
from Woodend invalids had left Dr. Brenton free for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
whole evening, and among the Altruist audience not one
had been happier than he. Now he went off with his
borrowed bath-chair and its weakly occupant, meaning
not only to see poor Mrs. Baker safely indoors, but to
satisfy himself that her husband, who had stayed
sulking at home, was propitiated by the present of
warm shirts and socks which Frances had chosen as
the likeliest pacifiers.</p>

<p>The boys were still in their fancy dress, and obliged
to wait in the school-room for Mrs. Morland’s carriage;
but Frances, in her cosy frock and jacket, could defy
the snow without, and she accompanied some of her
friends to the gate and saw them off. As the last
carriage full of boys and girls rolled smoothly away,
she still stood thoughtfully by the roadside. Frances
was thoroughly content; her heart seemed full of peace
and good-will to all the world, and lifting her face to
the moonlit sky, she searched half-consciously for those
old friends Orion and the Plough, while her happy
young face smiled in memory of all the joys that
evening had brought for her.</p>

<p>“She does look kind!” mused a lad hidden in the
shadow of some bushes opposite. “Kind and gentle
and good! It was worth while to tramp from Rowdon
to see Miss Frances’s face to-night. She has been
making folks happy, as her way is, God bless her!
I was afraid before I came,&mdash;but now I’m glad. Miss
Frances will be kind, I know she will. The boy’s
different, and I doubt he’ll be against me; but what
shall I care, if Missy is kind?”</p>

<p>Jim East lifted his head, and stood erect and
brave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, what should I care, with all the world against
me, so long as Missy was kind?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland, as may have been gathered, was
in a sense an indulgent mother, and her children
lacked nothing necessary for their health or their
comfort. Her personal interest in their private concerns,
their hobbies, their undertakings, their studies,
was regulated entirely by what she estimated as social
opinion&mdash;by the effect which the particular hobby or
pursuit in question might have on the position of
Frances and of Austin among their juvenile fellows,
and in the eyes of Mrs. Morland’s own acquaintances.</p>

<p>Thus, she had almost from the first set the seal of her
approval on the Society of the Altruists; because she
observed that Frances, as founder and leader of that
energetic body, had secured a kind of sovereignty over
her comrades; also, that the majority of the better-class
Woodendites spoke well of the young people’s
efforts, and gave honour to Frances as the inspirer of
all their best intentions. Greater still was the credit
given to the girl for the modesty which made her
obviously unaware of the good opinions she had won
from her mother’s friends, and for the unselfishness
which made her eager to admire the generous labours
of her supporters; and Mrs. Morland was careful to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
nothing to make Frances more self-conscious, and
therefore less attractive to critical eyes.</p>

<p>At home, the mother was content to give an
occasional peep into the club-room when a meeting
was in full swing, and to subscribe liberally when
funds were requisitioned; abroad, she was fond of
allusions to “my lassie’s up-to-date fancies,&mdash;which
really, you know, are quite amusingly altruistic”.
Mrs. Morland was by no means a popular person,
in spite of her local distinction. Woodend happened
to be favoured with, for its size, an unusually large
number of well-to-do residents; and among these, by
birth, by fortune, by knowledge of the world, Mrs.
Morland had an undoubted prominence. When qualities
of head and heart were considered, her claims
were less readily admitted.</p>

<p>Yet she was, in a degree, an able woman, though
her talents were purely social, and she had no sympathy
with art or with letters except in so far as
they might help to secure social consideration. Austin
inherited a share of his mother’s gifts, and was naturally
her favourite child. In Frances she detected all
those qualities which had least appealed to her in her
husband’s character; but as most people seemed to
find these traits admirable, she gave them toleration
on account of their value in the eyes of others.</p>

<p>Christmas-day dawned in what the girls and boys
of Woodend called “proper weather”&mdash;snow under
foot, clear blue sky and sunshine overhead. Frances
and Austin had worked hard on Christmas-eve at
church decorations, proving themselves Muriel Carlyon’s
best allies. Their mother viewed without enthusiasm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
the ornamentation of her pictures, furniture,
and walls, when the materials were holly and fir.
Indeed, she called such time-honoured greenstuff
“messy nonsense”, which soiled whatever it touched
when fresh, and covered the floors with litter when
dry. In church, she found it unnecessary to disapprove
of anything which had the sanctity of tradition
to support its use; and so she willingly granted Muriel’s
request that the two youngsters might be spared to
help her, and allowed to share her luncheon in order
to save the time spent in going home.</p>

<p>Muriel Carlyon was a popular person both in school
and out of it, but she certainly shone as a holiday
companion. She was as invariably ready to interest
herself in the latest schemes of harmless frolic as in
the soberer matters of daily life and duty, and had
been quite as enthusiastic as any of her pupils over
the plans for the great entertainment, quite as delighted
at its triumphant success. There were a few
among her younger friends who knew that her sympathies
could go deeper still, that she could sorrow with
the sorrowing, and point the way to seek for comfort.</p>

<p>The old rector, Dr. Stansby, looked on Edward and
Muriel Carlyon almost as a son and daughter. They
spent with him all they could of their scanty leisure,
and held it a pleasant duty to see that a sense of
growing infirmity should not touch his peace of mind.
No parish matter could be neglected while these two
workers watched over affairs, and Edward tackled
bravely the few abuses which old-fashioned prejudices
had rendered unassailable in the days when Dr.
Stansby had laboured alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>The brightness of the Christmas morning with
which my story is concerned was reflected in the faces
of Mrs. Morland’s pair of youngsters as they ran into
the breakfast-room to see what fate had sent them.
Their mother followed at leisure, her simple winter
morning-gown falling gracefully about her stately
person. She never had been known to be in a hurry;
and of late years the assured comfort of her circumstances,
and the small demands made on her for sustained
exertion, had weakened further her naturally
inert disposition. But she had a smiling face for her
children when they sprang back to throw their arms
about her and offer grateful kisses.</p>

<p>Before Austin’s place at table stood a beautiful
enlarging camera, which would surely be a priceless
help in the practice of the “dark art”; he found, too,
a fine array of photographic plates and papers, and
the latest thing in “print-washers”, as a gift from
his sister. All these matters being of moment in
regard to his latest hobby, the boy was certain that
no present could have pleased him better. Frances
found herself the possessor of a beautiful writing-case,
fitted with everything necessary and unnecessary.
Austin had amused himself and Max vastly
by a special journey to Exham in order to select
his present, which now astonished his sister’s eyes.
It was a plain wicker work-basket of enormous proportions;
and half an hour of coaxing had induced
Muriel Carlyon to line the monster with crimson silk,
on which were stitched at regular intervals great white
letters:</p>

<p>“FRANCES THE ALTRUIST”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>The peals of laughter with which Frances received
this offering, and in which Austin joined, almost
upset Mrs. Morland’s equanimity; but just as she
began to think of frowning, the lively couple calmed
down and pounced on the row of new story-books,
which were to be a joint possession.</p>

<p>Frances remembered for long afterwards the special
peacefulness and happiness which seemed to mark
the morning of that Christmas-day. Never had she
more thoroughly enjoyed the service in the old Woodend
church, with the rector’s benign face seeming to
greet each well-known member of his congregation,
and Edward Carlyon reading the familiar prayers,
and Muriel accompanying on the organ her well-trained
choir of boys and men. The choristers were
recruited chiefly from Mr. Carlyon’s pupils, so that
Austin was the soloist that morning, and sang with
bird-like clearness a vocal hymn of joy and praise.</p>

<p>The children dined late with their mother on great
occasions, and now, after a luncheon of sandwiches,
mince-pies, jelly, and cream, they hurried out for a
run which might assist digestion. Austin carried his
camera, for he pined to get a snow-effect, and thought
that the view of Woodend village from the elevation
on which his mother’s house stood would answer
admirably for a subject.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t worth while to bring my camera-case,”
announced the boy, as he darted round from a side-door
his arms burdened with impedimenta. “You
won’t mind carrying something, will you, Frances,
as it’s such a little way we’re going?”</p>

<p>“I always carry something,” replied his sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
calmly; “and I would have come to help you collect
your baggage if Mater hadn’t called me back to write
a letter for her. It was only a little letter, but it took
time. Everything takes time. I wish the days were
twice as long.”</p>

<p>“Well, as they’re at their shortest now, and we’ve
only two hours of light before us, we’d better scurry.
There, I’ve dropped my dark cloth, and I can’t stoop
to pick it up.”</p>

<p>“Mercy! Are your dark slides in it?”</p>

<p>“No, better luck.”</p>

<p>“But ought you to carry them without any covering?
I’m sure light will get in and fog the plates
when the sun shines like this.”</p>

<p>“It’s December sun,” said Austin testily. “And
what’s the use of calling the slides ‘dark’ if they let
in the light?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but surely you remember last week,
that waster you got&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If you’re going to begin by talking about
wasters&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind, dear!” cried Frances hastily,
remembering that Austin’s “wasters”, as he called
his spoilt plates, were sore points. The glory of his
few photographic successes could hardly, as yet, be
said to atone for the bitterness of almost universal
failure.</p>

<p>Austin had pulled three dark slides from under one
arm, a tripod from under the other, and had held towards
Frances the racked-out camera he had hugged
to his breast.</p>

<p>“If you’ll carry this tricky thing I’ll be awfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
obliged,” he said piteously. “I’m in mortal fear of
dropping it and smashing my lens.”</p>

<p>“All right!” agreed Frances. “Wrap the slides in
the dark cloth and I’ll take them also. That’s the
way. Now, let’s run.”</p>

<p>So Austin shouldered the tripod, and off they went.
Down the carriage-drive to the gate, and then along
the road overlooking the village till they reached the
desired spot. Here they cried a halt, and Austin set
up his tripod.</p>

<p>“No cap on the lens!” exclaimed Frances in dismay.</p>

<p>“Oh, crikey! Why didn’t you tell me when I
handed you the wretched thing?”</p>

<p>“I never looked at the lens. I thought you would
have made sure you had everything before you came
downstairs. Not that I need have thought so,” added
Frances grimly. “Last time, you forgot the dark
cloth; and the time before, when Max was with us,
don’t you remember&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“There you are again with your ‘rememberings’!”
muttered Austin. “A fellow can’t be expected to
keep his wits about him with you and Max chattering
like fun.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say!” laughed Frances. “Here, take the
camera, and I’ll run back for the cap.”</p>

<p>“Hang it, can’t I use my hand? I’m sure I’d cover
the lens all right.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you wouldn’t! Wait, and I won’t be
long.”</p>

<p>Frances scudded away, but when she had gone almost
out of sight, suddenly turned and scudded back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose you have filled the slides?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Filled them!” ejaculated Austin. “Why,” he began
lamely, “weren’t they full? I never thought of
that. And I want slow plates.”</p>

<p>“You dreadful goose!” cried Frances; and picking
up the slides, she raced away again.</p>

<p>Arrived in the dark-room, she found that only one
of the double slides possessed its piece of black card
for dividing the two plates. A search for the missing
necessaries delayed her a good deal, and might have
ruffled her temper had she not become resigned to
photographic muddles.</p>

<p>“Here I am at last!” she remarked cheerfully, as
she came up to Austin, who remained seated in philosophic
calm on the top of a five-barred gate. “There
were no cards in two of the slides.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” remarked Austin, “I thought perhaps you’d
lost the cap.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> had lost it!”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;it might have lost itself. Thank you ever
so much for going.”</p>

<p>“Let’s make a start, Austin. The sun’s sinking
down into the mist.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. It says in my photographic handbook
there are ‘immense possibilities in mist and
cloud’; and also, that ‘there is pictorial value in a gate
or a stile carefully placed’. Now, I haven’t been
wasting my time while you’ve been away; I’ve been
thinking over what that chap wrote. And I’ve made
up my mind to get the mist and the cloud and this
gate into my photograph.”</p>

<p>“Likewise the windmill, the group of poplars, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the whole expanse of Nature, I presume?” observed
Frances sarcastically.</p>

<p>“I dare say I could edge in the poplars&mdash;my lens
has a wide field,” said the photographer. “The windmill
is behind our backs.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to take the village.
And you can’t see the village through the gate or over
it. You must open the gate and go into the field to
get the view we wanted.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I believe I’ll give up the village in
favour of the gate. I’m certain I can ‘carefully place’
the gate on my ‘neg.’, so as to give it ‘pictorial value’;
and a gate is easier than a whole village. Besides,
the cloud and the mist will go in of themselves, not to
mention your poplars.”</p>

<p>“Get your beloved gate on the ground-glass, and
we’ll settle.”</p>

<p>This Austin proceeded to do, while Frances patiently
held the cap&mdash;the sixth which had been bought for
this particular camera. Each of the remaining five
had been dropped and trodden into a shapeless mass
in what its owner called “moments of remarkable
enthusiasm”. Anticipating such a moment, Frances
thought it well to watch over the survivor.</p>

<p>“I’m doing my best,” announced the operator from
the enveloping folds of his dark cloth, “but those poplars
are awful worrying. They don’t work in nicely
with the gate when it’s ‘carefully placed’.”</p>

<p>“Leave them out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not when I’ve promised you,” said Austin
courteously. “There, I’ve focussed the lot somehow.
Just take a peep, Sis, and admire my work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>Frances accordingly concealed the greater part of
her person from view beneath the dark cloth&mdash;which,
it may be noted, was of proportions as Brobdignagian
as Frances’s work-basket, in order to elude the light
which like a fiend seemed to pursue Austin’s dark slides.</p>

<p>“I see the gate on the extreme left,” commented the
critic, “and half the poplars on the extreme right, and
a long strip of hedge cutting the picture nearly in two,
and a foreground muddled into nothing&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You must have a muddled foreground,” interrupted
Austin. “It’s artistic.”</p>

<p>“Well, I like to tell a bush from a wall myself,”
said Frances; “but I suppose you’re an impressionist,
like those people your photographer-man writes
about. There’s plenty of cloud and mist, Austin; and
if you don’t think a picture with just a gate and poplars,
and a hedge and an impressionist foreground,
rather dull&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’d have liked a figure or two, ‘to give interest’,”
admitted the handbook student. “Of course I can
put you in.”</p>

<p>Frances groaned. She always was “put in”,&mdash;with
frightsome results.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” shouted Austin just then, “here come two
jolly figures for me!”</p>

<p>Frances looked, and saw Max Brenton and Betty
Turner tramping through the snow at a pace dictated
by Betty’s aversion to undue haste. Max lugged a
big basket in one hand and a small one in the other,
and was trying to keep up his circulation by whistling
vigorously. Betty was pensive, and disinclined at the
moment for conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>As soon as the two pairs of youngsters hailed each
other from afar, they began, after the fashion of their
age and kind, to rush together as though they had
been opposing currents of electricity. They met with
a bump and a shock and a great deal of laughter.</p>

<p>“We were just coming to you,” said Betty. “At
least, I was. Mamma has some friends staying with
her, and this morning each of them gave me something
for our Society stores&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How kind of them!”</p>

<p>“It was rather decent. So I thought I’d like you
to have the things, as it’s Christmas-day; and the
servants were fearfully busy, so I just took the basket
to bring it myself. Coming up the hill I got so hot
and tired, and I just sat down on my basket&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And might have been sitting there yet!” ejaculated
Max tragically.</p>

<p>“Only Max came and helped me up, and carried the
basket. It was nice of him, only he’s always in such
a hurry. In the other basket, the little one, he has
some nonsense of his own&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s what she calls Dad’s prescriptions.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope they’re not ‘every four hours’ bottles!”
cried Austin. “Do look, Max. Perhaps, by luck,
they’re ‘at bed-time’ potions. I want you and Betty
to be figures for me.”</p>

<p>“Got out the camera? My, what larks!”</p>

<p>The boys immediately set off at the best pace permitted
by the baskets, Austin giving a hand with the
altruistic burden. The girls followed, at Betty’s leisure.</p>

<p>“There’s no hurry about Dad’s things,” remarked
Max, setting his load down by the roadside and dashing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
at the camera. Max could be enthusiastic with
anybody. “What are you taking, old fellow? The
lens doesn’t seem to be pointing anywhere.”</p>

<p>“It’s pointing at a pictorial gate, an impressionist
foreground, half a group of poplars, and any amount
of mist and cloud ‘thrown in’. Frances actually says
my view will be dull!”</p>

<p>“Let’s look.”</p>

<p>Max accordingly popped under the cloth, and presently
emerged with a somewhat puzzled and dejected
appearance.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s all right,” he remarked humbly to
the owner of the camera; “though things do seem a
little mixed in front.”</p>

<p>“Poor Max! He doesn’t appreciate the charms of
impressionism,” said Frances, coming up arm in arm
with the serene Betty.</p>

<p>“Ha! there’s another figure for me!” cried Austin
next. “My star’s overhead this afternoon. Fly, Max,
and tell Florry to hurry up. She’s the very thing for a
photograph. There’s ‘pictorial value’ in any girl with
long hair and an animated expression.”</p>

<p>Max “flew” as desired; and, while he ran&mdash;by way of
saving time,&mdash;acquainted Florry at the top of his voice
with the honour in store for her. Florry naturally flew
to meet the honour, reached Max midway, caught his
hand, and dashed wildly back. They landed, at full
pelt, in the middle of Frances, Betty, Austin, the
camera, and the baskets. In the result, Austin and
the smaller basket became as mixed as the impressionist
foreground.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” said the boy ruefully, picking himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
up. “I’ve squashed your basket, Max, and all your
father’s things are running out in streams!”</p>

<p>The entire company precipitated themselves on the
snow to examine the ruin.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t medicine&mdash;it was port-wine,” confessed
Max in sorrow; “Dad was sending it to old Briggs.
Janet had made him some jelly and stuff, too. You
needn’t mind, though, Austin; it was my fault.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!”</p>

<p>“You needn’t mind, either of you,” said Frances.
“Mamma will give us some more port-wine, and we’ll
beg a jelly from cook.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Max fervently. “You’re awfully
kind, Frances,&mdash;Frances the Altruist!”</p>

<p>“Now for the figures!” Austin sprang with recovered
glee to his camera. “You’d better all stand
nicely up against my carefully-arranged gate.”</p>

<p>“But why should we all stand up against a gate?”
objected Betty. “Let half of us, at least, sit down.”</p>

<p>“Why should you sit down in the snow?” inquired
Austin sensibly. “I should say that, for choice, you’d
rather stand up.”</p>

<p>“I could sit on my basket,” murmured Betty. But
she allowed Austin to “place” her, as carefully as any
handbook could desire, exactly against the middle of
the gate, with Florry and Max on either hand.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we a bit stiff?” suggested Max mildly.
“Mightn’t I sit on top of the gate, instead of standing
in a row with the girls? Or, as Betty likes sitting,
couldn’t she mount the gate?”</p>

<p>“Catch me!” cried Betty.</p>

<p>“I’d hold you on,” said Max accommodatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“No, indeed!” said Austin severely; “Betty would
block out my best clouds. And if you held her on,
Max, I couldn’t take your eyes. I don’t fancy portraits
when you can’t see the folks’ eyes.”</p>

<p>“I could turn my face to you,” said Max persuasively,
with a lingering fondness for his bright idea.</p>

<p>Austin was immovable in his determination to arrange
his friends in line, and to photograph all the
eyes they could present to his camera.</p>

<p>Finally, after the usual agonized commands to his
sitters, Austin reached the vital moment and removed
the cap from his lens. He remained then in a state of
frantic uncertainty as to when he should put it on
again; and remained uncertain so long that, before he
could settle the important point, the six eyes watching
his changeful countenance and palpitating person began
to twinkle, and Betty giggled outright.</p>

<p>“There!” said the photographer, with the calmness
of despair, “that’s another plate done for!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry!” said Betty penitently.</p>

<p>“It isn’t as though it would have been a common
picture either,” continued Austin stonily; “we’ve lost
a really good thing. Not so much a snow-effect as a
figure-study, with mist and clouds and poplars.”</p>

<p>Betty was overwhelmed with shame.</p>

<p>“If only I could have made up my mind!” broke
out the artist bitterly. “If only I could have made
up my mind a moment sooner, I should have capped
the lens and saved my best picture!”</p>

<p>“Austin dear,” remarked Frances quietly, “you
have six plates in your slides.”</p>

<p>This simple speech effected an immediate transformation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Austin remembered that his little all in the
way of plates had not been torn from him. Betty
recovered her spirits, and having magnanimously
offered to “stand out, in case she spoilt another”, was
warmly pressed to remain in and be immortalized.
Frances suggested that, after removing the cap, Austin
should count ten under his breath, and then do the
deed. Florry added the useful hint that if Betty did
not fix her gaze on the photographer’s worried countenance
she might be better able to control her own.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Austin graciously, “you may turn
your head just a trifle, Betty, and stare at that fir-tree.
But I must have your eyes on the camera, Florry;
and I’d like one or two of your curling locks pulled
over your shoulder to show in front. I want to take
your long hair and your animated expression. I believe,”
finished Austin joyfully, “this picture will be
better than the other. I hadn’t remembered the ‘pictorial
value’ of Florry’s curls!”</p>

<p>After several agitated moments, the photographer
announced that his mission was accomplished.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe any of you turned a hair,” he remarked
gratefully. “I’m no end obliged to you. Let’s
all tear off home and develop this plate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Austin!” remonstrated Frances; “you’re always
in such a hurry! Do let’s take some more pictures
first.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll tell you what. We’ve six plates;
one’s spoilt, and one’s properly exposed. That leaves
four: one for each of you. I’ll sit on the gate, and
watch you take them. Only do be a little quick, for
I’m burning to develop my beautiful figure-study.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>A chorus of thanks applauded this generosity;
though, to tell truth, Austin’s possessions were always
freely at the disposal of everybody. All the present
party of friends knew enough of the photographic art
to be able to “take” something&mdash;what, they were not
quite sure until their work had gone through “development”
at the hands of Austin or Frances.</p>

<p>Frances now announced that her choice of subject
should be the village of Woodend, from the brow of
the hill whereon she stood. Betty wished to take a
portrait of Frances and Florry. Max was already
focussing Austin, as the latter perched on the gate,&mdash;“so
as to give the girls time to think”. Florry declined
to disclose her purpose till her comrades had had their
turns.</p>

<p>Austin’s eyes beamed with good-humoured triumph,
as he obligingly turned them full on his friend; and
Max “took” the eyes and their owner without any
discomfiting entreaties for attention and tiresome
worry about detail.</p>

<p>Betty was so charmed with Austin’s pose that she
insisted on Frances and Florry displacing him and
mounting the gate.</p>

<p>“I shall take you large,” she observed ambitiously;
“just as big as I can get you on to the ground-glass.”</p>

<p>The sitters made anguished efforts to keep still
while Betty, who despised haste in photographic
exposure as in everything, counted sixty aloud.</p>

<p>“I’ve given my plate a minute,” she said with satisfaction.
“Now something’s sure to come up.”</p>

<p>Frances carried the camera into the field, and
focussed her “view”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, put in a few figures to give interest!” begged
Austin. “My handbook says they’re an enormous improvement
to a quiet country landscape.”</p>

<p>“Well, if Max doesn’t mind, he might just run
across the field to that stile leading to the brook. He
could be crossing over it, as though he were going to
the village by the short cut.&mdash;When you’re half over
it, Max, you might stand still, and&mdash;and&mdash;just try to
look like moving.”</p>

<p>Max ran to execute the required task, and his
dramatic instincts brought him to a pause in an attitude
quite suggestive of motion.</p>

<p>“But he’s got his back to us,” objected Austin
loudly. “We can’t see his eyes. Hi, Max! Turn
round, I say!”</p>

<p>“No, no!” shouted Frances. “Keep still!&mdash;I couldn’t
see his eyes if he turned this way, Austin; he’s too far
off. This is a view, not a portrait.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Austin in disgust; “you could easily
have made it a figure-study.”</p>

<p>Frances, however, appeared satisfied, and speedily
recalled Max. To Florry now fell the post of responsibility,
and the last plate.</p>

<p>Florry, as dramatist, author, poet, painter, and
musician, was easily first among the artistic youth of
Woodend. Her social qualities were as naught in the
eyes of Mrs. Morland, for she did not understand how
to appear “to advantage” before select circles of her
elders, and among her fellows she held her many gifts
as the property of all. When the universal voice demanded
it, Florry emerged from her shell, and wrote,
painted, or played to order, without even the affectation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
of incompetence. She was the sole darling of a refined
and modest home, where her talents were wisely
nourished and never overstrained.</p>

<p>Florry, with a thoughtful brow, now delivered
herself:</p>

<p>“I wish you would all go and look at Max’s basket
again.”</p>

<p>“Why? What for?”</p>

<p>“I mean, just as you did before. Frances and
Betty squatting anyhow in the snow; Austin standing
up with his legs apart, his cap pushed back, his hands
in his pockets, and looking awfully ashamed of himself;
Max down on one knee, holding the broken
bottle, and with such a dismal face.” Florry caught
hold of the camera and led the way back to the roadside.
She had an idea.</p>

<p>“It will be a picture&mdash;we’ll call it ‘Disaster!’,” she
went on rapidly. “Frances and Betty will be showing
each other the wasted jelly and beef-tea. It won’t
be acting&mdash;it will be real.”</p>

<p>The young people threw themselves with their
usual enthusiasm into Florry’s plan. As they grouped
on the snow, Florry, who was careful of details, requested
Austin to turn up his collar in consideration
of the wintry atmosphere she wished to preserve in
the composition of her picture, and implored him to
look at the ruin he had wrought, and not to stare,
round-eyed, at the camera.</p>

<p>“Is it a quick plate?” she asked him.</p>

<p>“No;&mdash;I’m sorry. My handbook says slow plates
are best for snow-effects; and when we came out, I
meant&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind! Just wait a moment, as quiet as
you can, while I draw my shutter. But when I say
‘Now!’ mind you don’t wink an eye.”</p>

<p>“Winking an eye,” began Austin eagerly, “wouldn’t
show on a slow plate. It&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh! We sha’n’t hear Florry’s ‘Now!’”</p>

<p>The group waited and listened.</p>

<p>“I’ve done,” said Florry calmly. And she capped
her lens as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Why, you never said ‘Now’!”</p>

<p>“And I’m not going to. I wasn’t likely to let you
all look like statues.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been ‘took’ unawares!” cried Austin, dancing
wildly round Max and the basket.</p>

<p>“Florry’s a base deceiver!” said Frances, chuckling
over the little ruse. “Now we’ll pack our traps and
learn our fate in the dark-room.”</p>

<p>Subsequent proceedings in the ammonia-perfumed
apartment need not be here described, but I give the
result.</p>

<p>Austin’s developed plate revealed the distressing
fact that a trifling twist of the camera had caused the
disappearance of the half-group of poplars. There
remained to him the gate, with a tin-soldier row of
diminutive figures in front of it&mdash;their backs to the
fading light, and their faces consequently indistinguishable
as to eyes and all other features; a long stretch
of hedge, running aimlessly across the picture to the
right as though seeking a lost vanishing-point; a foreground
more mixed than the most ardent impressionist
could have believed possible; and a dark expanse of
nothing where the mist and clouds ought to have been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>Max had three portraits of Austin. That is to
say, his figure faithfully represented Austin at three
different moments, as the model had oscillated on his
slippery perch.</p>

<p>Betty’s desire for size had given her two gigantic
heads, which acknowledged her leisurely exposure by
deliberately fading away before her anxious eyes, leaving
her with a coal-black plate and a disappointed soul.</p>

<p>Frances’s lights were a little hard and her shadows
a little heavy; but Woodend village loomed with no
more than artistic vagueness on her plate, and her
short exposure had preserved her mist and clouds.
And Max’s far-off figure was quite life-like. Frances
hoped that her negative would, after all, yield a decent
print, and Austin was consoled by the thought that
Woodend village had been photographed at last.</p>

<p>There was no light in the dark-room save that
which came from Austin’s ruby lamp, and a flickering
reflection through the red-paned window of the
waning day without. Frances developed Florry’s
plate with friendly care, and announced results to
the group peering over her shoulders.</p>

<p>“It’s coming up!” was the first exciting news.
(Don’t press so, Austin dear; you’re shaking my arm,
and I can’t rock the dish properly.) “Oh, it’s coming
up all over, quite slowly, and ever so nicely! Not
those splashes of black here and there&mdash;which just
mean fearfully high high-lights, and nothing else in
particular,&mdash;and not black fog everywhere, like poor
Betty’s. Oh, it’s coming more, it’s getting plain! There’s
Austin’s furry collar, and Betty’s woolley cloud, and
Max’s black collar&mdash;I mean, his white collar showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
black! And there’s the basket, and the broken bottle,
and the spoilt jelly! It’s lovely! I think all the
details have come out now. Shall I stop?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” pleaded Austin. “Make it pretty dense,
then we’ll see ourselves through the back.”</p>

<p>So Frances resigned herself to future slow printing,
and developed a good, strong negative, which, when
fixed, rinsed, carried out to the brightest light attainable,
and examined through the back over a black
cloth, was found to reveal a delightfully natural presentment
of the agitated group round about the broken
basket.</p>

<p>Austin gazed long, and drew a tremendous breath.</p>

<p>“It’s a dream!” he murmured low, and turned away
full-hearted.</p>

<p>This triumph and Frances’s modest success were
carefully consigned to the plate-washer beneath the
running tap, the “wasters” were thrown aside, and
the troop of boys and girls departed to secure the
replenishment of Max’s stores.</p>

<p>Then the young folks prepared to separate. It was
Christmas-day, and long absence from home was
impossible. Max was due at the cottage of old Briggs,
and Frances and Austin must set him on his way. So
down the drive to the gate pelted the lively four,
promising themselves many more exciting hours with
the wizard camera, which could turn a roadside accident
into a “dream”.</p>

<p>Frances was still standing outside the gate, giving
a last wave to her retreating friends, when she caught
sight of a dark figure advancing from the direction
of the village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“Austin,” she called to her brother, “do come here.
I believe I see poor Jim East. Yes, I’m sure it’s he.
Fancy! Oh, poor Jim! Let’s stay and speak to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I don’t feel like saying&mdash;things.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so unkind. Surely we can show we’re
sorry?”</p>

<p>“Well, you do the talking, then. I’ll stick here in
the shade till I see what he looks like.”</p>

<p>“He’s walking very slowly. I’m sure he’s sad.
Oh, poor Jim!”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>JIM EAST.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Jim East, in his dark-hued mourning garments,
had from afar appeared sad indeed in the eyes of
Frances. As he came nearer, she saw signs not of
sadness alone, but of sensations more strange to the
girlish onlooker. The sorrow he had just experienced
could hardly account for the wistful expression in the
lad’s face, or for a certain hopefulness in his bearing.
Jim was coming forward to meet, with what courage
he could command, the crucial moment of his young
life. He was trying to assure himself that he had a
right to expect that the ordeal would pass and leave
him happy.</p>

<p>“He is very lonely,” reflected Frances pityingly;
“he has begun to feel that he is lonely. I wish I
could comfort him, but I don’t know how.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>Setting aside all possibility of administering comfort,
it must surely be a simple thing to condole and
sympathize with Jim. Frances felt that she could do
both, for she had sincerely liked the old grandfather,
and was glad now to recall the sacrificed holiday hours
for which he had thanked her with moist eyes and
grateful lips. She took a step forward lest Jim should
pass her with his usual quiet salute, but she saw that
this had not been his intention. He turned a little,
even before she moved, and directed his course to her
without hesitation.</p>

<p>“She will be kind,” thought the lad as his gaze
rested on Frances, and she greeted him with a smile.
“Grandfather was right, he said she would be kind.
If only she knew how I want her to be kind!”</p>

<p>Jim’s yearning was no more translatable through
his face than was his simple trust in a girl’s faith.
Frances had left him the treasured belief that in her
sight his work, however humble, was honourable; himself,
however lowly, above reproach. She had not
forced on him, as had Austin, more than once, the
recognition of differences of class, habit, and attainment.
These, she knew, were obvious enough to
modest Jim. Instead, she had shown him a gracious
friendliness which had roused the lad to wondering
gratitude; while her intelligent interest in his monotonous
labour had given it value apart from bread-winning
necessity.</p>

<p>Jim, in his ill-fitting cloth suit of rustic cut, was in
Frances’s eyes a much more pretentious and less
picturesque figure than Jim the blacksmith working
at his forge. A little half-conscious regret that Jim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
himself was likely to hold a contrary opinion was
promptly stifled by the remembrance that in his case,
at least, the wearing of mourning garb was no meaningless
form.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Jim!” Frances’s right hand rested
lightly on the half-opened gate which bounded the
carriage-drive to Elveley. “I’m glad you’re here. I’ve
wanted to tell you how very sorry I am for your
trouble. It isn’t only I, either; all of us boys and girls
are sorry. Your grandfather was always good to us;
and we liked him, ever so much. Of course,” she
went on gravely, “I know that we can’t feel as you
do, because you miss him all day long. But you won’t
forget, will you, when you are sad and lonely, that
we are sorry too?”</p>

<p>“No, Missy,” said Jim in a low voice, “I won’t forget;
and I thank you kindly for speaking so.”</p>

<p>“Then you will try to cheer up, won’t you, Jim?
And we will all come to see your dear smithy; and
you must come sometimes to our meetings and help
us with the village-boys.”</p>

<p>A scrape of Austin’s foot on the gravel warned
Frances of his strong objection; but at that moment
his sister’s thoughts were echoing the quavering tones
of an old man’s voice, begging her, when Jim should
be left solitary, to be kind to the lonely lad.</p>

<p>“We hope you will come to help us,” persisted the
girl.</p>

<p>“I’ll do anything as you may wish,” Jim replied.
“I’ll be proud to serve you, Missy.” He lifted his
head then; the gentleness of Frances’s accents moving
him to look to her face in search of help for the better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
meeting of his fate. The lad was in sore need of
some encouragement, for he knew that the errand
which had brought him to Elveley this Christmas-day
was one that might well startle, if it did not repel,
his listener. And above all things Jim dreaded to
see Frances’s pain or to hear her reproach. The
position he now occupied was intolerable to the boy’s
sensitive nature. But guessing instinctively that in
telling his story the simplest words would be the best,
and the briefest phrases the most acceptable, Jim
began his explanations without any sort of pretence
at ingenious circumlocution.</p>

<p>“I came to see you this afternoon, Missy, because
of something you don’t know about&mdash;something Grandfather
told me just before he died. I’m feared&mdash;I’m
feared it isn’t what you’ll wish to hear. Grandfather
told the doctor, too; but not till he’d promised to keep
quiet. Grandfather wished me to tell you myself.
He wished me to tell you on Christmas-day, because
then, he said, folks thought kinder of everyone, let
alone their own kindred. So I’ve been waiting all
day, but somehow I couldn’t bear to come. I wanted
to come, but I was feared, in case Grandfather was
wrong when he said you would be kind. He bade me
speak first to you.”</p>

<p>“Jim,” said Frances slowly, though her heart beat
fast, “I don’t understand you in the very least.”</p>

<p>“Likely not, Missy. But it’s true what Grandfather
told me, and I’ve brought the papers, as he wished, for
Madam to see.”</p>

<p>“For my mother to see?” asked Frances wonderingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“Ay, Missy. And,” added Jim, with a sudden,
natural break in his self-control, “won’t you please
try to be kind to me? I’m your own father’s son.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Frances, drawing back against
the gate. “Jim! You! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I’m Mr. Morland’s eldest son,” said Jim, in hurried
tones, vibrating with mingled hope and fear. The hope
was built on memory alone, the fear was roused by
the shrinking dread he had fancied present in Frances’s
face and voice.</p>

<p>“My mother was Martha East, Grandfather’s only
daughter,&mdash;there had been one son, who had died.
My mother wished to marry Mr. Morland, but Grandfather
wouldn’t let her, for fear he’d tire of her; so
they ran away, and married without leave. Mr. Morland
was good to Mother, and they were very happy.”</p>

<p>Jim paused a moment, in keen distress, for he saw
that Frances had grown white, and that she trembled
as she leant for support against the gate.</p>

<p>“Not long before he married, Mr. Morland had promised
a great Society in London to go for them to some
country where he had travelled, and try to find out
something they wanted to know. So when the time
came he was obliged to go right away to some place
in Asia; and before he went he took my mother to her
old home&mdash;for he had no relations of his own&mdash;and
begged Grandfather to take care of her till he came
back. When he’d been away three months, word
came to England that he’d been lost&mdash;taken prisoner,
and carried off by some robber-tribes. There was no
more heard of him, and Mother began to fret and pine,
for it was said he’d never come home again. Mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
lived only a few months after she’d got the news.
She said she couldn’t live without her husband. I was
born two months before she died.”</p>

<p>Jim hesitated, his voice faltering again as he glanced
at Frances’s face, in which the dread was now too clear
to allow of mistake. The hopefulness left the lad’s tones
altogether, and he finished his story in nervous haste.</p>

<p>“They thought I’d die too, but I didn’t; and Grandfather,
being alone, except for me, was glad I lived.
Mother had called me Austin after my father, and
James after her brother; but Grandfather always
called me Jim. He’d loved his daughter dearly, but
he was proud, and didn’t like her having married
among gentlefolk, who’d look down on him as just a
rough farmer. So, seeing he thought as my father was
dead, as well as my mother, he reckoned he’d keep me
and bring me up a working-man.</p>

<p>“I was six months old when Mr. Morland came
back. He had been rescued by some travellers, who
had been sent to search for him. When Grandfather
heard the news, he made up his mind as he’d keep
me still, and he did. They said in the certificate as
my mother had died of a fever that was about the
village where Grandfather lived then; and Grandfather
took this paper and went to town to meet my
father, and told him how Mother had died, but never
a word about me. My father was dreadfully grieved
not to find his wife waiting for him; and Grandfather
told him&mdash;quite true&mdash;how she’d always loved him,
and fretted after him, and spoken of him tender at
the last.</p>

<p>“Then Grandfather took me away to the north, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
he always managed to know where my father was.
He knew when Mr. Morland married again, and that
he had children, and when he died. And a few months
ago, knowing he was failing in health and soon to leave
me, he began to think as he oughtn’t to have kept me
away from my father’s folk, so that I’d be left all alone
in the world; and he found out where you were living,
and bought Rowdon Smithy so that we could settle
near you. He meant that some day I should come to
you and beg you to be good to me.” Jim’s eyes and
voice pleaded eloquently. “I’m your brother, Missy!
your own father’s son. I’ll always care for you and
little master if you’ll let me. I’d be proud to work
for you, only”&mdash;Jim sighed forlornly&mdash;“there’s naught
you need.”</p>

<p>Frances stood silent and utterly confused. She
might have fancied that Jim’s sorrow had turned his
brain, but for his intense earnestness and the straightforward
way in which he had told his strange story.
Again, she remembered facts which gave the story
corroboration. For instance, the old grandfather’s
solemn expressions of pleasure and satisfaction that
he had seen her, and his evident delight in witnessing
any kindness she had shown to his boy. Then
Frances knew that her father had been a distinguished
member of a learned Society, and in his youth
had travelled far to serve the cause of science. She
had heard of his romantic imprisonment and rescue;
and though she never had been told that he had been
married twice, she saw that in this respect Jim’s
statements might easily be true. Her father had died
while she was very young, and her mother might not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
have cared to speak, to a mere child, of her own
predecessor.</p>

<p>As she hesitated, painfully conscious of Jim’s troubled
and searching glances, she was relieved to hear her
brother step forward. What Austin would say she
could not guess, but at least his words might help her
own. The boy did not turn to her for prompting,
though he stood by her side, his face flushed and disturbed.</p>

<p>“Is it all true, Jim East,&mdash;what you’ve been telling
my sister?”</p>

<p>Austin’s tone was masterful, and by no means suggestive
of a willingness to believe; but it served to
rouse Jim’s pride, which had refused to help its owner
hitherto. The lad gained self-command, and after
answering Austin’s question with a simple “Yes”,
turned again pointedly to Frances for some sort of
comment. The girl felt that she must speak. Her
perceptions were always quick, though they gained in
force from her reluctance to hold them final; and now
her confusion vanished before the overwhelming certainty
that Jim had spoken the truth&mdash;that he, the
uneducated, shy young blacksmith, his face roughened
with exposure, his hands hard with toil, was indeed
her own father’s son, and her kin in blood.</p>

<p>“It is all true,” said Jim once more.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Frances passionately; “Oh, Jim, I hope
it is not true!”</p>

<p>“Not true!” repeated Jim blankly. “You hope it is
not true, Missy? Why?&mdash;I’m rough, maybe,&mdash;but I’d
never be rough to you. It is true, Missy; I’ve the
papers to show Madam. I’m your father’s eldest child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>Jim’s trembling hands sought vaguely in his pockets.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say it&mdash;don’t say it!” went on Frances,
in extremity of fear and distress. “It&mdash;it couldn’t
make any difference if it were true,&mdash;don’t you see?
We’re not alike in&mdash;in anything; we never could be
alike now. Oh, I don’t know how it sounds&mdash;what I’m
saying! I dare say it’s horrid, and conceited, and&mdash;and&mdash;not
fair. But it wasn’t we who settled whose
you should be; and it’s your grandfather’s fault, not
ours!” Frances hurried out her words as though her
own ears were ashamed to listen to them. “He kept
you back&mdash;he wouldn’t let you belong to Papa,&mdash;and
now he wants you to come to us, when it’s too late.”</p>

<p>“Too late?” echoed Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s too late!” repeated Frances almost fiercely;
“you belong to your mother’s people, not to us. You
know there is&mdash;a difference. If we were all little, it
wouldn’t matter; but Austin and I are too old not to
feel&mdash;to feel&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To feel shame of me, Missy?” suggested Jim
quietly.</p>

<p>The peasant lad was standing erect and calm, and
his grave eyes hardly hinted at the agony which had
come to him with the breaking of his happy dream.
If his imagination had idealized this young sister of
his, as well as a future which, in truth, would have
been impossible as he had pictured it, he could find
blame for no one save himself. His memory still
dwelt tenderly on his grandfather, and he now wondered
how he ever could have supposed that the
daintily-reared young Morlands would have a thought
of toleration for him and his claim of brotherhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“How can we help feeling ashamed? It’s not our
fault!” reiterated Frances bitterly.</p>

<p>“You didn’t feel shame to speak to me at the
smithy,” said Jim.</p>

<p>Then Frances, hardly knowing how to account for
sensations of repulsion which she knew to be unworthy,
broke into child-like tears.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you were a very nice blacksmith,” she
sobbed, “and your house was clean and tidy, and we
liked to see the forge.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t exactly want a blacksmith-brother?”
added Austin interrogatively, while he looked curiously
at his sister.</p>

<p>Frances seized his hand, and tugged it nervously.</p>

<p>“Oh, Austin, come away!”</p>

<p>“Wait,” interrupted Jim, in a dull voice; “won’t you
stay till I’ve seen Madam? I promised Grandfather I’d
see Madam, and show her the papers, to prove he’d told
true. Mayhap she won’t turn from me,&mdash;won’t you wait?”</p>

<p>“I can’t!” murmured Frances, shrinking as Jim advanced.
“And Mamma will only be angry if you go
to her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why she should be angry,” said Austin,
who was the best controlled of the three. “Go up to
the front door, Jim East, and they’ll let you in. Then
you’ll see our mother. I’ll wait here.”</p>

<p>“Austin, come with me!” begged Frances.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I’ll wait here.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Morland laid the papers aside with a little
well-bred gesture of courtesy. Careless her examination
of them had seemed to Jim; but in reality she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
had grasped their contents accurately, and had no
doubt that they were genuine. The stately, beautifully-dressed
woman leaned back in her luxurious
chair, and her fine eyes, which had forgotten their
youthful softness, scanned Jim from head to foot.
She seemed to find his appearance amusing.</p>

<p>“My good lad,” she said, in her clear, refined voice,
“I am quite aware that I was Mr. Morland’s second
wife, and that his first was beneath him in station.
He was an honourable man, and he told me all the
facts of his pretty rustic idyll. I believe that he even
told me that the young woman’s name was Martha
East. In any case, there is no reason why her name
should not have been Martha East. Nor is there any
reason why she should not have left a child. I do
not wish to profess incredulity concerning your statement
that you are Martha East’s son, and that your
existence was hidden deliberately from Mr. Morland
by your grandfather. Such an action would, of course,
be underhand and selfish; but one does not expect
from the uneducated classes a great refinement of
motive or honesty of conduct. It would be unreasonable
to do so. It would have been unreasonable, for
instance, if I had supposed that, when this piece of
news was communicated to you, you would have
resolved to spare Mr. Morland’s other children the
pain and annoyance of hearing it also. That would
have been the sort of conduct I could have had the
right to expect only from a gentleman. Your grandfather’s
training would naturally teach you differently.
It would incline you to take the course which promised
most gain to yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>Jim raised his eyes and looked steadily at the
speaker.</p>

<p>“I do not blame you,” continued Mrs. Morland, with
a quick movement of deprecation; “your behaviour
has been according to your lights. It makes it the
more easy for me to credit your story, which has,
however, no concern for me or my children. As your
grandfather probably knew, Mr. Morland was not a
land-owner, and his fortune was absolutely at his own
disposal. Consequently, his will would hold good; and
the discovery of an elder child would in no way affect
his provision for my son and daughter.”</p>

<p>“Madam&mdash;Madam,” said Jim sternly, “you have no
right to think as I was wanting the money!”</p>

<p>“Then what did you want?” asked Mrs. Morland,
smiling slightly. “You wished, perhaps, that I should
adopt you&mdash;take you to live here, as my children’s
equal and companion?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jim, speaking firmly and bravely, “I did
not wish that. I only hoped as you’d allow I belonged
to them, and had a right to care for them, and&mdash;they
for me.”</p>

<p>“Poor boy, you are quite modest and nice! I am
afraid you do not precisely understand social distinctions.
Your grandfather made choice of your
future position for you, when he concealed your birth
from my husband. You have been brought up a
working-man; and it would be impossible, as it is quite
unnecessary, for you to fit yourself for any other kind
of life.”</p>

<p>“I had no thought of doing so,” said Jim, maintaining
his composure in spite of failing heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“I have no doubt that when you come to reflect,
you will see matters in a sensible light. For your
sake, I am sorry that your grandfather, having kept
silence so long to suit his own convenience, did not
keep it to the end to suit yours. You would have
been happier without this foolish revelation, which I
advise you speedily to forget. I will say nothing more
about your coming here; you have merely obeyed your
grandfather’s selfish wish. But there is something I
must say concerning the future.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland raised herself, and, leaning forward,
spoke in a firm, distinct tone, very different from her
previous cynical indifference.</p>

<p>“You must understand, once for all, that I can
allow no sort of acquaintanceship between you and
my children. They are mine, and I have the right to
decide what is best for them. They have, I believe,
shown you some kindness&mdash;in return, I readily admit,
for kindness shown to them by your grandfather. You
and they are therefore quits, and I wish all intercourse
between you and them to cease from this moment. I
understand that your grandfather bought for you a
cottage and workshop at a place called Rowdon, not
far from here, and that he provided for you according
to the needs of the station in which he brought you
up?”</p>

<p>“Ay, Madam.”</p>

<p>“To some extent, then, he justified his conduct.
Well, in the same way I have bought a house here, I
have placed my children at a school where they are
happy, I have surrounded them with the comforts, the
pleasures, the luxuries, to which they are accustomed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Morland stumbled for a second, as her eyes
rested on the rough clothing and labour-hardened
hands of her husband’s eldest son. But if there was
an opening for reproach, Jim did not avail himself of
it.</p>

<p>“I do not envy them their better fortune, Madam.
Indeed, I do not.”</p>

<p>“You have no occasion to. If you have missed what
you might have had, it has been no fault of theirs or
mine. I have settled here, in my own house, and my
children are learning to love their home. You, perhaps,
are attached to yours. I have no wish to suggest
that you should go elsewhere, and I should prefer not
to do so myself. At the same time, my resolve that
you and they shall hold no intercourse is unalterable;
and I will rather break up my home than have its
peace destroyed. If you will give me your promise to
keep silence on this purely private matter&mdash;which
never ought to have been brought forward&mdash;and to
refrain from forcing yourself on my children, there is
no reason why you and they should not rest undisturbed.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland waited in an anxiety to which her
manner gave no clue.</p>

<p>“I never thought of telling anyone,” said Jim simply.
“I never meant to come here against your will. I’ll
promise, as you wish.”</p>

<p>He picked up the papers Mrs. Morland had laid
aside, and thrust them back into his pocket. The
young blacksmith would have been puzzled to know
what was meant by theories of life and analyses of
conduct; but he did not lack intelligence, and he perceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
that he was being treated unworthily by his
father’s widow. For the two children he had lately
left he had no condemnation, though from them had
come the only stabs which had reached his heart.</p>

<p>“I’ll go now, Madam,” he said. “I’ve done as my
grandfather bade me, and I hope you’ve seen as he
spoke true.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” reflected Mrs. Morland, while Jim was closing
the door softly behind him, “the wretched old man
did ‘speak true’! That boy has his father’s eyes and
expression&mdash;he is like Frances. None of those marvellous
resemblances one reads of in story-books, of
course; but there are sometimes traces which recall
personalities more closely than a stronger likeness
would. I hope, I hope against hope, that he’ll keep
his word! If he’s his father’s son, he will.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Down by the garden-gate Frances and Austin Morland
awaited Jim’s return. Frances had striven hard
to draw her brother away; but as he would neither
leave his post nor talk to her, she remained by his
side, acutely miserable. With tongues inactive, the
girl and boy thought the more. Frances felt a self-accusing
shame which she could not escape and did
not know how to justify. She was not old enough
to probe her nature with searching finger, and find
there that very sensitiveness to the opinions of others
which she always had thought so poor a thing. She
wondered only why the sudden appearance of a
blacksmith-brother should seem so great a misfortune
to her&mdash;to her whom her friends had nicknamed
“Frances the Altruist”, who had appeared to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
a mission for the better instruction of less liberal-minded
persons! She was a sinner against her own
code, a traitor to her own cause.</p>

<p>Frances did not tell herself these facts: she merely
felt them in a kind of vague disturbance. Self-consciousness
is not a fault bred in public schools;
and the influence which, though brief in duration, had
so strongly affected her, had not tended to develop
unchildlike self-introspection.</p>

<p>“Here he comes.”</p>

<p>Austin spoke at last, and his sister, with a little
shiver, drew close to him. The boy laid his hand on
her arm, in a gesture which was at once affectionate
and protecting.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Sis. We can’t help things happening.”</p>

<p>Jim’s footsteps drew close. The lad had forgotten
Austin’s promise, and in the gathering darkness did
not quickly see the watchers by the gate. He gazed
straight before him as he came, and would have
passed the two Morlands had Austin not stepped
forward.</p>

<p>“You’ve seen my mother, then?”</p>

<p>Jim, with a start, looked at the speaker, not knowing
what his own face revealed.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I’ve seen Madam.”</p>

<p>“You showed her those papers&mdash;whatever they were?
Did she believe what you said?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It didn’t make any difference. I’d rather be
going, please,” added Jim, trying to open the gate on
which Austin had laid his hands.</p>

<p>“Stay!... No, never mind! I’ll ask Mamma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
myself.” Austin opened the gate, mounted it, and
swung out with it into the roadway. From this convenient
perch he fixed a steady and observant gaze
on the figure of the unwelcome visitor.</p>

<p>“We might have said good-bye to him?” queried
Frances in a shaking voice.</p>

<p>“Perhaps&mdash;if we’d meant it,” returned Austin carelessly.
“Frances, I’m going to Mamma. You come
too.”</p>

<p>So Austin led the way. Mrs. Morland had already
sent a servant to look for her children, and they met
the man on the steps.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room Austin put his questions
straight.</p>

<p>“Jim East has been here, hasn’t he, Mater? He has
been telling Frances and me queer things. Are they
true?”</p>

<p>“How am I to know what he has told you, my
darling?” asked Mrs. Morland diplomatically.</p>

<p>“He told you too, didn’t he? He said he was our
brother.”</p>

<p>“Your half-brother, dearest,” corrected Mrs. Morland
gently. “A mixed relationship merely. You
need not remember it.”</p>

<p>“Is it true? Is he our father’s son?”</p>

<p>“I believe he is. I shall make inquiries, of course,
but I have no doubt they will confirm his story. He
brought proofs which appeared to me sufficient; some
letters of your father’s, for instance.”</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, while Austin stood thoughtful,
and Frances scanned her mother’s face.</p>

<p>“I tell you these things, children,” continued Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
Morland composedly, “because I wish you to understand
the position clearly, and also my wishes with
regard to it. This poor lad is probably your half-brother,
but he has been brought up apart from you,
and you and he have nothing in common. There
are many reasons why I could not possibly allow
you to be intimate with him. Such persons have
different thoughts and feelings, and use different
language, from any I could allow you to become
accustomed to.”</p>

<p>Austin looked steadily at his mother.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen Jim East&mdash;no! I suppose it’s Jim Morland!&mdash;a
good many times, Mater. I don’t know about
his ‘thoughts and feelings’, but I’ve never heard him
say a word you wouldn’t have liked us to listen to.”</p>

<p>Frances saw her brother glance at her for confirmation,
and murmured lamely: “No, he always spoke
nicely.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” said Mrs. Morland drily.
“That lessens my regret at having let you both come
in contact with your poorer neighbours. Indirectly,
we owe all this nuisance to your fads and nonsense,
Frances.”</p>

<p>“Mamma,” said the girl, colouring, “Jim’s grandfather
evidently meant to send him here some day.
Mr. East came to live at Rowdon on purpose.”</p>

<p>“It is horrible to think we have lived under a sort
of espionage,” said Mrs. Morland impetuously. “The
old man’s conduct, from first to last, was disgraceful.
Let me never hear you speak of him again. And let
me hear no more of the wretched boy he left behind.
Austin and Frances, you will give me your word of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
honour that you will not again visit Rowdon Smithy,
and that if you come across that lad anywhere you
will take no sort of notice of him. You understand
me?”</p>

<p>Frances murmured a reply.</p>

<p>“Then I have your distinct promise, Frances?”</p>

<p>The girl knew that her brother was watching her.
He, of course, would follow where she led.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mamma.”</p>

<p>“Yours also, Austin?”</p>

<p>“Well, ... no.” The boy threw back his head
with a proud motion. “See, Mater, I don’t want to be
cheeky, or to vex you ... and what you say may
be all right for Frances. She’s a girl; and though I
can’t see what harm she’d come to at the smithy, I
suppose she’s got to stay at home if you want her to.
But I don’t care twopence about charity, and humble
neighbours, and Altruists&mdash;except to please Frances,
and join in any lark that’s going. I’ll cut the lot if
you like. But if Jim is Jim Morland and our brother&mdash;half
or whole&mdash;I’m not going to cut <i>him</i>. That
would make me a jolly cad, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Austin, who was certainly innocent of any desire
for melodramatic effect, stopped abruptly, the better
to observe his hearers. Frances had dropped her face
between her hands&mdash;now, why on earth, Austin asked
himself, had she done that? Mrs. Morland had started
upright, angry and bewildered. What was the matter
with her? Did she suppose&mdash;did anyone suppose&mdash;a
fellow was going to cut his own brother?</p>

<p>“Austin!” exclaimed Mrs. Morland, “do I understand
that you threaten to disobey me? Do you wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
to make me miserable, and bring shame upon us all?
Don’t imagine I shall allow you to do it. You are
only a child, and utterly incapable of judging for
yourself on so important a matter. You will simply
do as I order you. By and by, when you come of
age, you can of course throw my authority aside. In
the meantime you are entirely under my control. I
forbid you to speak again to this young blacksmith.
That is enough.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland leant back on her cushions almost
overcome. Her agitation was very real; for though
Austin had not interrupted her, she had seen no sign
of yielding on his handsome, boyish face&mdash;out of
which, as she had spoken, had passed all the carelessness
and all the pride.</p>

<p>“Mater&mdash;I don’t know how to tell you properly&mdash;but
I think you’d speak differently if you had seen
Jim at the gate just now. Frances had chucked him
up, you know, when he came first; and then you had
chucked him up, and he was going away without a
word. He looked awfully <i>down</i>. I thought it was
hard lines.”</p>

<p>Austin pushed away, with an abrupt, half-nervous
movement, the chair across which he had been leaning,
and thrust his hands into his pockets. He was a
typical little Englishman&mdash;a boy of that nation which
despises demonstrations of sentiment; but there was
an honest flush on his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mater,” he continued, “don’t you believe
that if our father were alive he’d take Jim home
this very minute? Wouldn’t he have him here with
us, and treat him just the same?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Morland sat speechless.</p>

<p>“I think he would,” said Austin soberly; “I truly
do. And,” he continued, a delicate instinct prompting
him, “I can’t tell why you don’t; only, of course,
I don’t know about all the things you know of. I’m
just settling about myself. I saw Jim going away,
looking <i>down</i>, and I meant to ask you to send someone
to fetch him back.”</p>

<p>“Austin!”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Mrs. Morland indignantly, “I will
not hear of such a thing. Do you suppose I will have
all Woodend sneering at my blacksmith-stepson?”</p>

<p>The boy kicked a stool vehemently.</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t ask what isn’t any good. But I’d like
to go after him myself, and say&mdash;something. And I
think I’ll go.”</p>

<p>“Austin! you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll just go.”</p>

<p>The boy was near to the door. He reached it in a
few quick, firm steps, turned, waved his hand smilingly,
and went.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland sprang up and moved some paces after
him, then, with a helpless sigh, moved towards Frances.
Why did not she run to stop the daring offender?</p>

<p>But Frances had sunk into a chair, and was sobbing
bitterly. Shrugging her shoulders, Mrs. Morland
stepped rapidly to the bell and rang it.</p>

<p>“John,” she said to the servant who appeared at the
door, “I wish you to try to catch Master Austin. He
has just left the room, and has, I think, gone out of
doors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“I saw Master Austin in the hall just now, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Make haste, then, and bring him back.”</p>

<p>John hurried off, much exercised in his mind concerning
his mistress’s distressed manner; and though
used to a dignified pace, he fairly ran down the carriage-drive,
threw back the gate, and stood gazing, now this
way, now that.</p>

<p>“Can hardly have got out of sight in this time,”
reflected the puzzled servant. “Well! if that isn’t
the sound of a pony coming down the drive! Master
Austin must have got the beast saddled double-quick.
What’s our young gentleman up to, I’d like to know?
Well, I’ve got to stop him, I suppose.”</p>

<p>John stood prepared in the middle of the gateway;
and as Austin trotted into close quarters the servant
explained his mistress’s orders.</p>

<p>“Look here, John,” said Austin, his eyes glowing
with mischief, “I’ve an excellent regard for you, and
I’d be sincerely sorry to cut short your valuable career.
But if you don’t move a bit to one side I’m afraid I’ll
make short work of you. I’m going through that gate
this instant!”</p>

<p>As he spoke the boy touched his pony; the plucky
little animal sprang forward, John sprang backward,
and with a joyous laugh Austin was off down the road
at full gallop.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Jim tramped steadily through Woodend village,
noting his whereabouts only when his heedless progression
brought him to a stop in the deep snow
gathered at the sides of the pathways, or sent him
floundering against wall or fence half-hidden in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
heavy shadows. His thoughts kept him company, and
shut out intrusive sensations concerning the white
world around him. The lights blinked through the
trees from the houses standing back among their
gardens, and the sounds of mirthful family meetings
strayed sometimes to the lad’s ears. It was Christmas-day&mdash;the
day on which, so old Bill East had said, folks’
hearts beat tenderly for all their kin. Lower down
the valley cottage-homes stood humbly in their tiny
plots; and the windows, often uncurtained, revealed the
rough comfort within. Homes of another sort&mdash;as
those of Lumber’s Yard&mdash;lay back from view: among
them Dr. Brenton and Max were paying a round of
Christmas calls before settling down for the evening
they never cared to spend apart.</p>

<p>Jim tramped on. He had reached the entry to
Lumber’s Yard, where a knot of the male residents
had gathered for a sociable chat until it should be
time to repair to the parlour of the “Jolly Dog”. One
of the men called out to Jim, whose face was just then
visible in the light from an open cottage-door. The
lad heard the gruff greeting,&mdash;it came from Harry the
Giant,&mdash;and the well-meant invitation which followed it.</p>

<p>“Why, Jim East, you’re looking rarely glum and
peckish! Cheer up, lad. Come wi’ me, and ’ave
summat hot to hearten ye. We’re all agoing into the
“Dog” this minnit. Come along wi’ us.”</p>

<p>Jim paused irresolutely. Before his mental vision
loomed the smithy, infinitely dreary; no welcome
awaiting him save from four-footed friends. The old
woman who kept the place clean and cooked meals for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
the Easts had begged a holiday, which had been granted
cheerfully. Jim shivered as he thought of the lonely
rooms.</p>

<p>It was a searching moment for the poor lad. The
cruel rebuffs of his kindred had cut him to the heart;
more than that, they had threatened the ruin of his
moral sense. If he were a creature so repellent in the
eyes of those to whom his inner self had turned with
instinctive yearning, surely he must have been mistaken
in supposing that his nature could have qualities in
common with theirs. Beauty of form, colour, or sound
had always roused in him a glow of happiness, in
which, during the last fortnight, he had tried&mdash;with a
kind of grateful wonder&mdash;to recognize some latent
refinement such as he supposed to be the inalienable
possession of the gently born and bred.</p>

<p>He was the son of one whom even his grandfather
had admitted to be a gallant and honourable gentleman.
He was the brother of Frances, with her
gracious manner and gentle speech, and of Austin,
whose gay courtesy towards his girl-playmates had
secured Jim’s respectful admiration. But since Frances
and Austin would have none of him, whither should
he turn? Could he carry into his lonely, loveless life
that higher purpose which would teach him, without
help or sympathy, to shun the base and impure, and
to cling to the thing which is right? Or must he
sink, sink at once and for ever, to the level of such as
these?... Jim dragged his thoughts from the
memory of the beautiful home from which he had
just been banished, and forced his eyes to rest intelligently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
on the slouching figures blocking the entry to
Lumber’s Yard.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Harry;”&mdash;the lad’s voice had an unusual
firmness&mdash;“you are kind, but I must be getting home.”</p>

<p>“There’s none to greet ye now,” persisted the giant
good-naturedly. “Change your mind, and come wi’ us.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” said Jim quietly. “Good-night, and thank
you, Harry.”</p>

<p>More arguments, some rough, some jeering, followed
him as he shook his head and walked on towards the
darkening lanes beyond the village bounds. He chose
mechanically the shortest way to Rowdon; and he
had just turned into a by-road overhung by leafless
elms, when a galloping pony caught him up, and was
reined in with a jerk by his side.</p>

<p>“Jim!”</p>

<p>The lad started violently, and turned in amazement
to see Austin Morland leaning from his saddle with
hand outstretched.</p>

<p>“Jim! I’ve come after you. Shake hands, old
fellow.”</p>

<p>Jim, still staring, obeyed half-consciously. The grip
exchanged by the brothers satisfied Austin, and sent
through Jim a strange thrill of joy.</p>

<p>“I can’t quite make out things yet,” continued the
younger boy, a little shy, but wholly friendly; “my
mind’s a bit mixed, I fancy. But I know one thing&mdash;if
you’re Jim Morland, we’ve got to stick to each other.
Eh?”</p>

<p>Jim muttered a choky affirmative.</p>

<p>“Well, you are Jim Morland. Mater says so; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
if she seems fussy at first, you and I aren’t going to
worry. Perhaps she’ll come round. Anyhow, we’ll
stick to each other. Eh?”</p>

<p>“Ay&mdash;I’d give the world for you. I’ll not forget.”</p>

<p>“If I could, I’d come with you now. But Frances
and I can’t leave the Mater to-night. You see, Jim,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Dear lad, I’d not have you come.”</p>

<p>“But you will have me&mdash;ever so often. Whether
you like it or not. I’ve holidays now. See, Jim!
I’ll come to-morrow, in the afternoon quite early.
Will you look out for me?”</p>

<p>“Will I not?”</p>

<p>“Then good-bye now. Because of Frances and
the Mater, you know. Don’t mope to-night, there’s a
good fellow. I’ll come to-morrow, and won’t I wake
you up! Shake hands again! Now I’m off. Good-bye,
brother Jim!”</p>

<p>The swift pony and his rider vanished. Jim Morland
stood where they had left him, and his head sunk
in his hands. Who shall despise him if, in his overwrought
condition, he sobbed for very happiness?</p>

<p>“And to think I nearly missed him! Ah, if I’d
gone along of Harry! Thank God I didn’t.... I’d
never go now. I’d never do aught to make him feel
shame of me. I’ll care for him always&mdash;ay, and for
Missy too!... He called me ‘brother Jim’, God
bless him!”</p>

<p>Jim went on through the darkness. At the smithy
he found that Elizabeth had returned, made up his fire,
and laid his table. Jim wandered about, too happy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
eat. He was no longer alone in the world: he had a
small brother, who was coming to see him to-morrow,
and on many morrows. (Jim hardly paused to wonder
how Austin had contrived to overcome his mother’s
objections.) At last the lad dragged a chair to the
blazing fire in the kitchen. His dog crouched at his
feet. His great black tom-cat purred at his elbow.
His fiddle invited a song of thanksgiving to which his
heart piped its cheerful chorus.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>FRANCES FALTERS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>On the following day Austin paid his promised visit
to Rowdon Smithy. There was no deceit in
the boy, and he proclaimed his intention openly at
home. The contest on the subject between himself and
his mother was sharp and brief: Austin gained the
day. Mrs. Morland had no idea how to enforce her
commands, for she had at her disposal no means of
coercion. Had it been possible to send her son to
school, she would have taken this step immediately;
but her husband’s objections stood in the way. There
were no near relatives to whose charge she might, for
a time, have consigned the little rebel, save the Scotch
cousin with whom Austin had spent the last Easter
holidays; and this cousin had gone to Australia to
take up sheep-farming, in hopes of making a fortune,
marrying, and settling down as an antipodean millionaire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
Meanwhile, he was making short work of his
patrimony; and Mrs. Morland did not exactly see her
way to employ him as jailer.</p>

<p>A settlement between the opposed forces was brought
about by the wise diplomacy of Austin. The boy had
always found that he had more than enough to do in
taking care of his own conscience, and it did not for a
moment occur to him that he was the appointed keeper
of anybody else’s. Least of all was he inclined to try
to dictate to his mother and Frances on points of duty
or conduct; if only they would let him alone, he was
quite willing to be equally tolerant.</p>

<p>So Austin struck a bargain. His visits to the
smithy were to be permitted, in return for a promise
that he would not enlighten Woodend as to Jim’s
revelations. Austin claimed one exception&mdash;he must
and would tell Max everything. Dr. Brenton knew
already; and the doctor and Max had no secrets from
one another; so that Max, most likely, was already in
possession of the strange news. Anyway, Austin
could not shut out from his confidence his special chum.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland made the best of the matter, and secured
for the present her own peace of mind by holding
an interview with Max’s eccentric father.</p>

<p>“Eccentric” Dr. Brenton certainly was in the eyes
of Mrs. Morland, who had not hitherto entrusted the
health of herself or her children to a medical man not
possessed of a carriage and pair. The high esteem in
which the Doctor was held by the gentle-people as well
as the working-folk of Woodend had roused first her
curiosity and then her scorn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“You must look more closely, dear Madam,” the
old-fashioned Rector had said to her, “and beneath
Brenton’s shabby coat you will see the spreading of an
angel’s wings.”</p>

<p>“I think not, sir,” Edward Carlyon had differed
quietly; “beneath the shabby coat you’ll see only a
shabbier waistcoat. The wings can wait a bit: we
want the man.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland was persuaded that she could secure
the Doctor’s silence, and indeed she did so. But she
did not forget, during a whole uncomfortable day, the
“eccentric” man’s look as he bowed agreement to her
request. Dr. Brenton heartily wished Jim well, and
he knew that Mrs. Morland’s departure from Woodend
would in no way help the lad; but while he handed
his visitor to her carriage with punctilious courtesy,
he wondered what manner of woman this was who
could stoop to inflict so great an injustice.</p>

<p>Though in the case of Austin Mrs. Morland gave
way to what seemed to be necessity, she was careful
to hold Frances to her promise. And Frances wavered
miserably between the two parties, in this house divided
against itself. Of one thing she was sure&mdash;she could
not have taken the half-measures which had satisfied
Austin. Had Frances acknowledged her brother at all,
she must have acknowledged him to all the world.
The feeling that in this respect Austin had fallen
short of consistency warped her sympathy with his
actions, and to some extent seemed to justify her own.
She, surely, was at least consistent.</p>

<p>When poor Frances reached this stage in her meditations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
she began to falter. She remembered that
she was still the leader of the Altruists, and that a
score of boys and girls paid her real homage as the
inspirer of deeds of self-denial and mercy. When the
Carlyons’ school reopened after the Christmas vacation,
Muriel’s pupils began slowly to detect some
changes in their popular comrade. The girls with
whom she had seemed hitherto to have least in
common were those who now met eagerly her tardy
advances. To be sought as friend and playfellow
by Frances Morland had been a happy distinction
to any of Miss Carlyon’s little band. Frances had
never affected superiority, and it was impossible to
suspect her of vanity; but her clear gray eyes had
appeared to look beneath the surface, and to choose
with unerring confidence the best natures as those most
akin to her own. Her gentle sincerity had appealed
to every loyal heart and won its ungrudging recognition.</p>

<p>Now, in the society of her former favourites, she
was dull and ill at ease; and when her new friends
gathered round her, only too ready to hail her as leader,
her instinctive contempt for the offered loyalty made
her capricious and even tyrannical. Muriel Carlyon,
who watched over her pupils with a very real tolerance
and sympathy, knew a pang of disappointment
as she saw Frances apparently content to reach a
lower plane in character and conduct.</p>

<p>At home, the girl’s altered demeanour was not less
apparent than at school. Her influence over Austin
must have gone for ever, she told herself, or he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
not have differed from her on a point which was surely
a test of individuality; and having so made up her
mind, she soon brought about the state of things which
had been purely imaginary. It was true that Austin
had begun to spend a good deal of his leisure at the
smithy, but he would at any time have given his
sister’s affairs the preference. Now, however, Frances
no longer invited his willing aid. The chemicals and
dishes in the dark-room, once so fascinating, were
thick with dust, since Austin found photography “no
fun” without Frances. Prints had duly been taken
from the two negatives which had been the Christmas-day
successes, and Florry’s group and Frances’s
landscape had been admired by half Woodend. But
Frances could not endure the sight of either; and
when copies were begged, no coaxing or pleading from
Austin would induce his sister to help him to take
them.</p>

<p>The boy laid aside his camera and took up his
fiddle. His patient teacher, a young Exham musician,
was delighted with his sudden progress; and Mrs.
Morland smiled complacently while she whispered to
her friends:</p>

<p>“Yes, Austin has always been musical&mdash;so like his
dear father. Mr. Morland had quite a reputation as
an amateur violinist. The Amati that is now Austin’s
was once his. It gives me so much pleasure to see
my dear boy take up in earnest the study of his
instrument.”</p>

<p>On reception days Mrs. Morland’s servants were
sent to playroom and garden in search of the juvenile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
prodigy, but their efforts were vain. Austin’s performances
were strictly private&mdash;private to himself
and his brother Jim. For Jim’s sake he listened to
his teacher’s instructions, and strove, in half-hours of
self-sacrificial practice, to communicate those instructions
to his own finger-tips. Then, later on, he could
pass them on to Jim. And Jim sat willingly at
Austin’s feet in the art and science of music, and
found no evening dull on which he could pore over
the exercise-books his brother had brought him, and
repeat again and again on his own poor instrument
some passage whose difficulty Austin had tried to help
him to overcome.</p>

<p>For many weeks matters held to the same course,
and the Easter holidays came round to complete the
year of Mrs. Morland’s residence in Woodend. Jim
had kept his promise, and had not sought to make
public the secret of his birth; and Dr. Brenton and
Max and Austin had proved equally faithful.</p>

<p>Max’s training, as much as his natural endowment,
had given him a large heart and a most tolerant judgment.
He was “all things to all men” in the best
sense. With this true friend, Austin attempted no
concealments, and felt that, without disloyalty, he
might venture on a discussion of the one epoch-marking
experience of his young life. He even tried
to win from Max some opinion as to Frances’s share
in Jim’s dismissal and banishment.</p>

<p>“For it wasn’t a scrap like her,” remarked Austin
in a puzzled voice; “Frances has always been such a
stickler about justice and that, you know. Goodness!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
she’s down like a shot on a chap who doesn’t play
fair&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She used to be,” amended Max diffidently. The
talk was of another fellow’s sister, and he trusted his
tongue would remember its duty. “The other day,
when Lal slanged Guy because Guy won that prize
Lal wanted, I believe every girl except Frances slanged
Lal in his turn for his sneakiness.”</p>

<p>“My! wasn’t there a jolly row!” said Austin, chuckling
at the recollection. “Ten of ’em all together giving
it hot to that skunk Lal!”</p>

<p>“Frances would have led the assault once on a time.”
Max smiled, remembering not Lal’s rating only, but
many occasions when Austin’s sister had exchanged
her usual serenity for hot contempt of conduct base
and ungenerous.</p>

<p>“Yes, she would,” assented Austin slowly. “And
that’s what I can’t make out&mdash;why she’s so different
now.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s because she’s so really fair and straight,”
said Max in a sober voice, which breathed chivalrous
determination to believe in the absent Frances. “And
if she knows all the time that she isn’t exactly fair to
Jim, she won’t want to come out strong about ‘justice’
when other folks trip.”</p>

<p>Austin nodded his head in agreement. “That’s it!
Besides, she’s a girl, and girls are cranky things; a
fellow never knows quite how to take ’em.”</p>

<p>“Not a fellow’s own sister?” queried Max, with
interest.</p>

<p>“Bless you, no,” replied Austin, shaking his head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
this time, and speaking with conviction. “Why, I
could make out any other chap’s sister better than I
can make out Frances. But of course,” he added,
sitting very erect, “Frances isn’t a common girl. She’s
not so understandable as the rest of the lot, even.”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” began Max seriously, “what she
told me yesterday? She said she thought she’d have
to give up being an Altruist!”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed Austin.</p>

<p>“She did! And I said: ‘Oh, Frances! don’t break
up our club. It’s the first of our Woodend things
which has gone on and been a success.’ And she said:
‘Of course it will go on, and far better without me.’
And I asked her why; and she said something, very
low, about the nicest sort of girls&mdash;the girls who were
the best Altruists&mdash;not caring for her as they used to
do; and that they didn’t come so much to the meetings,
and that she thought they would if she weren’t the
leader.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Austin, in a crestfallen tone, “fancy
Frances chucking up her beloved Society! She trots
about with the Mater, too, ever so much more than
she used to do, and it’s a bad sign. Imagine Frances
sitting in a drawing-room, wearing her best togs,
when she might be playing hockey with us!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;fancy!” echoed Max dismally.</p>

<p>“She goes out to tea, like any silly, when she might
be making bromides with me in the dark-room.”</p>

<p>“Well, she gave me two pinafores out of the Altruists’
stores last week,” said Max, brightening; “she’s been so
stand-off lately I was afraid to beg.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps things will pick up,” said Austin. “I
know what would make them do it soonest.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Why, for the Mater to find out what a jolly good
fellow Jim is, and make it up with him. Then Frances
could follow suit, without any humble pie. There’s
nothing a girl hates so much as having to own she’s in
the wrong.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The kindness he received from his young brother
sank deeply into Jim’s heart, and went far to heal it
of the soreness left by Frances’s repudiation of his
plea for a kinsman’s position. Jim, as he truly put
it, “thought the world of the lad”, and was almost
pathetically proud of his handsome face and gallant
bearing. During the prevalence of the bleak March
winds Austin caught cold, and had one of his bad
throats; and Jim was miserable all day and all night,
except when Max was with him, assuring him that
the boy was “getting on splendidly”, and promising
to deliver to the interesting invalid every kind of
affectionate message, supplemented by such gifts as
were within Jim’s reach.</p>

<p>Austin got well, and resumed his custom of riding
to the smithy at least two or three days a week. The
first time he went after his convalescence, he received
from Jim a welcome which he never could forget.
The elder lad’s wet eyes, shaking hands, and broken
voice were evidence enough of his clinging love for
the younger; and Austin realized, with some sobering
emotion, that to his brother he was infinitely dear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>A closer relationship grew between them. When the
occasion served, they had long talks, and learned to
know one another. Jim’s simple manliness of thought
and deed roused in Austin a respect which kept down
his secret impatience with his brother’s extreme tenderness
of heart. Austin felt dimly that Jim ought to be
resentful of the harsh decree which shut him out from
the ease and luxury of the home at Elveley, and
denied him the advantages due to his father’s son.
He even tried to “stir Jim up a bit”, and encourage
him to stand out against the powers that were.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s mine,” remarked Austin one
day, after much pondering over matters which had
forced themselves on his boyish consideration, “but
I’m sure you ought to have most of it. Why don’t
you pluck up, Jim, and say so? Then you could study
and go to college as you’d like to; and you’re such a
grind, you’d come out an awful swell, and make the
Mater and Frances proud of you!”</p>

<p>To his surprise, Jim turned from him with a pained
expression, and leaning against the window, murmured:</p>

<p>“Lad, lad! Do you think I’d take aught from you?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be from me, really,” persisted Austin.
“It would be only having what’s rightfully yours. Well,
there! Don’t mope, Jim! Come on and give us another
lesson in shoeing. I believe I’ll soon be able to tackle
a gee all by myself. Won’t it be larks when I can!”</p>

<p>Austin presently realized his ambition; and a fine
dray-horse was proudly shod by a young gentleman
in spotless flannels, while his admiring elder brother
looked on to prompt and praise. Mrs. Morland was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
spared the knowledge of this achievement; but Austin
confided it to Frances without hesitation. Frances’s
native love of consistency moved her to vindicate her
chosen position by a hot reproof of Austin for his unconventional
conduct.</p>

<p>“Well!” said the boy, profoundly bored, “you don’t
stick to your own opinions, Miss Frances. Wasn’t it
you who used to talk about any honest work being
noble and beautiful, and all that tommy-rot? Now I
don’t say shoeing horses is noble work, or beautiful, or
anything. I just say it’s first-rate fun!”</p>

<p>And Austin turned on his heel and went off.</p>

<p>“There!” thought Frances bitterly, “he has gone
away; he never stays with me now. He isn’t a bit
my boy any longer. He’s Jim’s. Oh, how I wish
we never had come to Woodend! But Jim says his
grandfather always managed to know where we lived.
How horrid it seems! I wish I’d been different to
Jim. He looked so sorry. I think&mdash;I think I hurt
him. I wish I were brave, and didn’t feel ashamed for
people to know I had a blacksmith for a brother! I
hate to think of anyone pitying us about Jim, and
sneering at his funny clothes and way of speaking!
I know I’m a ‘snob’, and that Miss Cliveden would
scorn me now; but I can’t help it.”</p>

<p>Doubt of herself made Frances doubtful of others,
and she began to show signs of developing that unlucky
sort of suspicion which searches motives with intent
to prove itself in the right. Her common-sense told
her that the best of her girl-friends could not despise
her for conduct of which they knew nothing; yet she,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
who had been above all things frank and sincere, now
continually imagined slights and offences on the part
of her favourite comrades. But Frances had been too
well liked to be readily regarded as an outsider by
any of Muriel Carlyon’s brightest and busiest lassies.</p>

<p>It was not until, in a mood of hopeless discontent,
she carried out her purpose of deserting the flourishing
Society she had founded with so much energy
and success, that a deputation of alarmed and amazed
damsels pursued Miss Carlyon into her private sitting-room,
and demanded that she should, then and there,
tell them what could be the matter with Frances.</p>

<p>“She called a meeting in the schoolroom after
hours!” cried Florry Fane breathlessly; “it was to
let us know that she wasn’t going to be our leader
any more! She said we should do better without her,
and she proposed that I should be the Altruist secretary&mdash;as
though any one could take Frances’s place!”</p>

<p>“It is true,” said the First Violin&mdash;a pensive maid
known to her elders as Dorothy Gray,&mdash;“that we
have not attended the meetings so regularly as we
used to; but that was all because Frances has seemed
so different.”</p>

<p>“In what way ‘different’?” queried Miss Carlyon
quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh! in every way. She used to talk such a lot
about helping people, and to be full of plans for all
sorts of ways to make our Society some real good to
the Woodend poor folks. We were going to have a
bazaar in the summer, and build a club-room which
would be open in the evenings and entice the men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
from that dreadful inn at Lumber’s Yard. It was to
be a secret until we had held another meeting.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were bringing me some news,
Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“Of course we were going to tell you all about it
before we decided anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear. And must the project fall through?”</p>

<p>“Why, I suppose so. We could not get on without
Frances. She is so good at arranging and managing.
Besides, it would seem so strange and unfriendly to
throw ourselves into anything heartily with Frances
out in the cold.”</p>

<p>“But if Frances has chosen that uncomfortable
position?”</p>

<p>“Can’t we get her away from it? Do help us, Miss
Carlyon!”</p>

<p>There was a minute’s silence, while Muriel watched
observantly the half-dozen young faces turned eagerly
to hers.</p>

<p>“My dears,” she said soberly, “I am with you in
your surprise at the change in Frances, and in your
natural longing to understand it and to win your
friend back to her old ways. Let us put our heads
together, and see what we can do. First, let us ask
Florry, who has been so much with Frances, whether
she can suggest any reason for the lassie’s whims.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I can,” said Florry slowly; “you see,
she isn’t the kind of girl to back out of things in
order to be flattered and fussed over, and begged to go
on with them. Frances isn’t a bit vain. She’s too
much in earnest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>The other girls assented in chorus.</p>

<p>“Can her mother have raised objections to her doing
so much for your Society? Mrs. Morland is taking
Frances about with her more than she used to do, and
she may wish her daughter to use her leisure differently.”</p>

<p>Florry shook her head. “No&mdash;it can’t be that.
Frances told me her mother had promised to help with
our bazaar, and to persuade her friends to work for it.
We should hardly have gone on thinking about it
else,” added Florry bluntly, “because the Woodend
people all follow Mrs. Morland like sheep.”</p>

<p>“We needn’t criticise our elders on that point,” said
plump Betty Turner, “for we all follow Frances like
sheep. Why not? Someone must lead.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Morland’s leadership has been used most
kindly on behalf of the Altruists,” said Miss Carlyon
gently. “No doubt it would serve the bazaar to good
purpose, and I still hope your grand plan may be
triumphantly worked out. And now, dear girls, as
you cannot clear up the mystery of Frances’s behaviour,
may I, without discouraging you, own that
you mustn’t look to me for enlightenment? If there
is anything behind, I am not in Frances’s confidence;
I can judge only from what appears on the surface.
Isn’t it possible that the very honours you have thrust
upon her&mdash;the popularity, the responsibility&mdash;may
have become something of a strain? Perhaps she may
feel that, for a time at least, she would rather remain
in the background, while those who have learned to
imitate her courage and energy may take their turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
in coming to the front. In any case, I can’t help
believing that your best course will be to persist in
your gallant undertakings, and to let our Frances
see that her efforts have not been thrown away.
She has borne the burden and the heat of the day,
and she may flag for awhile only to spring forward
more gladly and willingly after a well-earned
rest.”</p>

<p>“But our Society!&mdash;our Club, without Frances!”</p>

<p>“Must go on and prosper, if only to maintain its
founder’s credit. If your Club-room at Elveley is no
longer available, you shall hold your meetings here.
Persevere, lassies, persevere! And before long&mdash;I feel
sure of it&mdash;Frances the Altruist shall be again in your
midst.”</p>

<p>The news that her daughter had abandoned her pet
hobby was quite a shock to Mrs. Morland, who had so
long been accustomed to see her children to the fore
in every juvenile scheme, that she could not recognize
the value of a light hidden under a bushel. She reproached
Frances long and scornfully for her voluntary
abdication of her small queenship; but the girl
listened in silence, and with an expression of weariness
and indifference which increased her mother’s
vexation. Mrs. Morland felt the disappointment and
chagrin Austin and Frances were causing her all the
more because such sensations were so new and strange.
She had always congratulated herself on the possession
of a pair of youngsters who were made for future
social success. And here was Austin, of his own
choice, spending half his play-hours at a vulgar smithy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
And here was Frances handing over her girlish
honours to Florry Fane.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland’s fretting and the children’s divided
interests made of Elveley a different home. The three
members of the little family were drifting apart slowly
and steadily. During Austin’s short illness, mother
and daughter drew nearer in the press of a common
anxiety; but as soon as the boy was about again, and
galloping his pony to and from Rowdon Smithy, he
seemed to become once more a being outside Frances’s
world.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<small>TROUBLE AT ELVELEY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was August, and the evenings were sultry and
oppressive after burning summer days. At Rowdon
Smithy there was always some coolness, borrowed
from the adjacent moorland, and helped by a situation
exposed on northern and eastern sides. So, when
dusk drew on, and Jim’s work might, as a rule, be
considered over, the young smith used to sit in his
trellised porch, with book in hand or violin on shoulder,
and enjoy such breezes as were to be had. The place
pleased him for several reasons. It had been a favourite
resting-spot of his grandfather’s, it caught the latest
beams of the sun setting across the Common, and it
commanded a fair stretch of the road by which Austin
might be expected to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Austin came now oftener than of old. Jim sometimes
wondered why: he had, as it seemed to him, so
little entertainment to offer to his brother.</p>

<p>On a particular evening of this sunny August, Jim sat,
as usual, in the cottage-porch. His hands were busy
with his fiddle, his eyes were bent over a sheet of
music which Austin had lent to him. Jim had changed
much during the last few months. His face and figure
had matured and grown manlier; he was dressed with
more care, and had the fresh, “clean” look peculiar to
upper-class Englishmen. There was but slight trace
of the peasant about him, and his homely language
sounded pleasantly enough in his soft, clear voice&mdash;which
even to Austin’s ears was quaintly reminiscent
of Frances’s sweet tones. His manners and bearing
were seldom at fault; for old William East had known
something of the ways of gentle-people, and, acknowledging
within himself a duty owed to the lad’s
deceived father, had taken pains to shield Jim from
bad example and to encourage his natural refinement.
The sorrow of his bereavement, and the keen pain
of his rejection at the hands of his sister and stepmother,
had indeed saddened his young face; but they
had also deepened and strengthened his character, in
teaching him to stand alone.</p>

<p>The sound of a trotting pony advancing along the
hard, white country road broke in on Jim’s peaceful
studies and caught his attention. Hoping that the
nearing rider might be Austin, Jim sprang to his feet,
laid aside his fiddle, and swung briskly down the
garden-path to the gate. As he went, he saw that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
young brother was putting his pony to the gallop, with
evident impatience to reach his journey’s end. Jim
threw wide the gate, and stepped out on to the roadway
in time to wave a welcome to his visitor. Then
he saw that Austin’s sunburnt cheeks had lost their
ruddy colour, and that his eyes looked scared and
strange as from a nervous shock.</p>

<p>“Why, Austin! What’s up, lad?” asked the elder
brother anxiously. “There’s surely something wrong.”</p>

<p>“Everything’s wrong, Jim! Everything’s dreadful!
You’d never guess what’s happened at home! Don’t
try: I’d rather tell straight out. Perhaps I shall feel
better when you know, too!”</p>

<p>“It’s no harm to Madam or Missy?”</p>

<p>“Harm to all of us, I think, Jim. At least, Mother
says we’re beggars! Isn’t that harm enough? Jim,
don’t stand and stare like that!”</p>

<p>Jim pulled himself together. “I was frighted, lad,&mdash;feared
to think of what you might mean. ‘Beggars!’
Surely not ‘beggars’!”</p>

<p>Austin laughed roughly. Child as he was, the
trouble which had overtaken him, and the way in
which it had been met, had affected him strongly.</p>

<p>“Well, Mater says so: and I suppose she knows.
Jim, I’ll ride round to the shed and fasten up Rough
first of all.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come with you,” said the other briefly; and
they made the short journey in silence. When the
pony had been safely tethered, Austin caught Jim by
the arm and dragged him off.</p>

<p>“Not indoors!” said the boy impatiently. “I feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
choked already. Let’s go to the orchard. Oh, how jolly
quiet and cool it is here! At home&mdash;.”</p>

<p>Austin paused, and held his tongue perseveringly
until the brothers had gained a favourite retreat in
the pleasantest nook among the old apple-trees. Jim,
even then, forbore to question, guessing that his young
brother’s nerves were strung to a pitch which would
not bear further tension. With considerate kindness
the elder lad forced back, out of sight, his own fears
and forebodings.</p>

<p>Austin threw himself on the ground with a long-drawn
breath of relief. The calm of his surroundings
and the friendly presence of his brother brought a
happy sense of protection to the overwrought lad.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll tell everything,” he said, drawing near to
Jim, who immediately put an arm about him. “Only
I can’t explain very well, because I don’t half understand
myself. It was this morning it happened. A
man came from London to see Mamma; so he was
taken to the library, and she went there to speak to
him. The library has a French window opening on to
the lawn, and Frances and I were sitting together in
the garden, quite near the library window. We could
hear Mamma and the man talking, but not well enough
to know what they were saying, so we did not think
we need move away. Presently we did hear something:
we heard Mamma say plainly, in a queer, high
voice, ‘Then I and my children are paupers!’ Frances
jumped up, and so did I; and we both ran to the
library window. It wasn’t what Mamma had said; it
was the way she spoke. Jim, it would have scared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
you. Just as we got to the house we heard a sort of
cry. Well, we pushed open the window in a jiffey;
and there was Mamma, lying all of a heap in her chair,
and the strange man standing beside her, looking
frightened out of his wits. And he said to us: ‘I’ve
brought your mother bad news, but I couldn’t help it;
I’ve nothing to do with the matter. The governor
sent me down from town to tell her, because he thought
it would come easier that way than in a letter or a
telegram.’ Of course we didn’t know what he meant,
and we didn’t much mind, we were so awfully scared
about Mater.”</p>

<p>“Madam had fainted?” questioned Jim in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Yes. We called her maid, and brought her round;
while the man vanished into the garden, saying he’d
stay there a while in case he was wanted again. I’d
have told him to cut back to his precious ‘governor’,
only Frances wouldn’t let me. And as soon as Mamma
could speak she asked for the London man, and in he
came. I must say he looked sorry; and he didn’t
seem to like it when Mamma said she wished him to
tell Frances and me exactly what he had told her.
Then&mdash;oh, Jim! I can’t remember half his long speech.
It was all about deeds, and securities, and fraudulent
trustees, and creditors. There was a man who had
charge of all our money&mdash;Mamma’s and Frances’s and
mine,&mdash;and was to manage for us till I was twenty-one.
Papa had made him ‘trustee’. He had always given
Mamma plenty of money for everything she needed,
and she had never thought anything was wrong.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
But a while ago he wanted to make more money for
himself; and first he used only what was his own, and
lost it; then he began to use ours, and lost that.
When nearly all ours was lost, and he knew he must
soon be found out, he managed to get hold of what
was left of Papa’s money, and then he ran away. So
he has gone; and we shall never find him, or get back
what he stole.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Jim breathlessly, “what a sore,
sore trial for Madam! Does she bear up, dear lad?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Austin gloomily; “and that’s the
worst of it all. Mamma seems so very&mdash;queer. She
sits and moans and groans, and tells Frances and me
over and over again that we’re just beggars, and must
go to the workhouse. Jim!” added Austin, with a
break in his voice, and a childlike dread which made
him shiver nervously, “Jim! must we really do that?”</p>

<p>“No, dear lad, no. Why, Madam has her beautiful
house anyway. She told me she’d bought it.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but it isn’t all paid for,” said Austin, shaking
his head. “The London man said Mamma’s trustee
hadn’t paid for lots of things. Elveley is to be sold
and all that’s in it; and even then Mamma won’t be
able to pay everybody.”</p>

<p>“I can’t hardly take it in,” muttered Jim. “Are
you sure it’s as bad as you say?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure enough,” said Austin bitterly, “seeing
Mamma has said it all over and over again. Frances
and I have stayed with her,” continued the lad,
throwing up his arms wearily; “but this evening I
thought I must come here for a bit, or I’d&mdash;I’d howl!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Jim, you can’t guess what it’s like, at home. Mamma
can’t do anything but groan.”</p>

<p>“But Madam has many friends?” suggested Jim
hopefully.</p>

<p>“What’s the good of friends? They can’t find our
trustee&mdash;or make our money come back again. And
we’ve no relations except Cousin Walter, and he’s in
Australia, sheep-farming. Don’t I wish I could go to
Australia, and have heaps of land, and millions of
sheep!” Austin closed his eyes, the better to call up
a vision of plenty. “But Cousin Walter’s a failure
out there: he can’t help us.”</p>

<p>“There’s surely someone,” said Jim, unable to think
of the stately, handsome owner of Elveley as friendless,
penniless, and homeless. The lad might have
been pardoned a gleam of satisfaction at the ruin
which had overtaken the woman who had treated him
with contemptuous indifference, and shown no intention
of acknowledging his just claim to a share of his
father’s property. But Jim was guiltless of resentment,
and the inherent chivalry of his nature rose up
in indignant pity at the blow dealt to the widow and
orphans.</p>

<p>Jim thought much and deeply, but he wisely said
little in the meantime, preferring deeds to words.
Austin succeeded in convincing him that in Mrs. Morland’s
sight, at least, her case was desperate; and Jim
the simple-minded could only marvel how so many
years of prosperity and social success could have been
unfruitful of a single friend attached and loyal enough
to come forward with counsel and help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“There must be someone,” he repeated, with conviction.
“Austin, lad, this is too soon to talk so hopeless-like.
Mayhap your mother is fair dazed with the
shock, and too upset to think clear. Keep up heart,
dear lad, and cheer Madam and Missy too. Tell them
as all must come right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jim!” broke out Austin, “I wish you would
come to Elveley and make some sense of things! It’s
so awfully bothering to go on not knowing what will
really happen, and with Mater not able to tell us.
Jim, do come home with me now!”</p>

<p>“Dear lad, I’d come with you gladly, but I haven’t
the right&mdash;yet. I promised your mother I wouldn’t
tell who I was; and what would folks think to see
Jim East the blacksmith meddling with Madam’s
affairs? No, it would just worry her more if I should
venture&mdash;it would make things harder for her to see
me there. I mayn’t do it, lad. It’s terrible vexing to
know I mayn’t.”</p>

<p>Jim’s reluctance was so evidently reasonable and
unselfish that Austin forbore to press his entreaty.
Instead, he allowed himself to be comforted and encouraged
by all the arguments for hope and cheerfulness
which Jim could draw from his imagination. At
the smithy, Austin always felt happy and at peace.
The difficulty was to tear himself away and go back
to the home whence peace and happiness had fled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Morland, as has been said, was not personally
popular in the village where she had made her home.
Woodend was, in a sense, old-fashioned, and it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
acquiesced quietly in her assumption of leadership in
all that concerned its small social matters, but it had
not learned to like her. Though its upper-class community
was no less charitable than others similarly
placed, there were not a few old residents who heard
the story of the Morland downfall, as it affected the
mistress of Elveley, with hardly more than a conventional
murmur of regret. But when her children were
under discussion the case was different. Everyone
liked the bright girl and boy, everyone grieved at the
tragic calamity which must so greatly change their lives.</p>

<p>Still, there were some neighbours able and willing
to show Mrs. Morland kindness and sympathy. These
sought her out at the earliest moment that good taste
allowed, and frankly offered to be of service; but the
poor woman, completely overwhelmed by the extent
of the disaster, rejected their overtures with angry
scorn. Naturally, her well-meaning friends retired
precipitately, determining that she should be left to
take her own course.</p>

<p>What that course should be Mrs. Morland did not
even attempt to decide. The creditors who had insisted
on the sale of Elveley wished to show the innocent
debtor some consideration, and informed her that
she might continue to occupy the house for three weeks.
The Rector, who was not to be driven away by any
rebuffs, listened patiently to the outpourings of bitter
invective against her fraudulent trustee, which seemed
the only relief Mrs. Morland could discover. The
kindly, gentle old man was too infirm to fight an
injured woman’s battles; but Edward Carlyon persuaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
Mrs. Morland to put her affairs in the hands of
a competent solicitor, who might make the best terms
possible with her creditors.</p>

<p>The three weeks of grace had almost slipped by,
and still no provision had been made for the future of
the little family. Frances and Austin seldom left
their mother, though in her presence they were acutely
miserable. They were young and vigorous, and, after
they had recovered from the shock of misfortune, they
were eager to be up and doing. Both girl and boy
implored their mother to speak&mdash;to tell them what her
plans might be, so that they might help forward any
arrangements she had made. But Mrs. Morland declared
herself incapable of action, and was not moved
even by the pale and anxious faces of the harassed
pair who were ready to take the field in her behalf.</p>

<p>It was an awakening period for the two young Morlands.
Hitherto they had felt a childlike security in
the capacity of a mother’s protecting love and care.
The world’s struggles and trials had seemed far removed
from the sheltered comfort of their home. Now,
the arm that had encircled and shielded them had
been suddenly removed, and the onset of trouble found
them defenseless.</p>

<p>“If only we knew what was going to become of us,”
sighed Frances in Miss Carlyon’s ear. “It is so
dreadful to feel day after day passing and not to have
the least idea what Mamma will do. Sometimes
Austin and I think she really does not understand
that we must leave Elveley immediately; but if we
try to talk about it she will not listen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“Dear child, your mother has received a very heavy
blow. Who can wonder if it has prostrated her?”</p>

<p>Miss Carlyon’s tone was extremely pitiful, though she
could hardly think without impatience of the crushed,
broken woman who, even for the sake of her children,
would not rouse herself out of her state of despondency.
The girl and boy whose future had promised to be so
bright were surely the chief sufferers; but Mrs. Morland’s
pride saw as yet only her personal defeat&mdash;her
loss of position, her coming poverty.</p>

<p>“I know how very hard it is for Mamma,” said
Frances; “Austin and I would scarcely mind at all if
only Mamma need not lose all her things. I do want
to help her, but she says I am just a girl, and of no use.
And Austin is not grown-up yet. Oh, Miss Carlyon,
is there no work I can do? I think I could take care
of children, and I would do anything.”</p>

<p>“Dear Frances, you are so young to leave home.”</p>

<p>“Should I have to leave home? I don’t think I
could bear to go quite away among strangers. What
would Austin do?”</p>

<p>“What, indeed? And how could your mother part
from her only daughter? Your place is at home,
darling.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Frances in a shaky voice. “I
don’t seem much good to Mamma; and perhaps, after
all, Austin would not mind now. He does not want
me as he used to.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” asked Miss Carlyon gently, while
she stroked the girl’s bent head.</p>

<p>“It is because I am different,” said Frances dejectedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
“I have been mean and horrid, and Austin
knows.”</p>

<p>Muriel Carlyon remained silent, half-expecting that
her young favourite would open her heart, and give
her confidence to her friend. But Frances’s tongue
was tied by her promise to her mother; though, in
this time of trial, when sight seemed clearer and duty
plainer, she did long to cast away the burden of deceit
and tell the truth before all the world.</p>

<p>“Do you think anyone would take me as a nursery
governess, Miss Carlyon?” asked the girl presently.</p>

<p>“No, dear, I do not. People do not engage little
maids of fourteen for posts of responsibility.”</p>

<p>“I am nearly fifteen. Of course I know that is not
old, but I could put up my hair.”</p>

<p>Muriel replied with a loving kiss.</p>

<p>“I might try a grey wig,” suggested Frances, throwing
her arms round her friend; “and spectacles, you
know,&mdash;like a girl in a story-book.”</p>

<p>“Even then, I am afraid, you would be nothing but
a dear young lass, by no means formidable enough to
pose as a governess.”</p>

<p>“You are formidable,” said Frances, hugging Miss
Carlyon close. “And your hair is not grey, but pretty
brown curls; and you look, oh! ever so young and
jolly! It cheers me up just to see you.”</p>

<p>“Have that cheer as often as you will, darling; and
believe it doesn’t make troubles lighter to meet them
with a gloomy face.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s what Florry says.”</p>

<p>“Florry is a first-rate philosopher&mdash;an unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
preacher, too, of the gospel of plain living and high
thinking.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how she argues&mdash;you know she loves
to argue. This is exactly what she said:&mdash;‘If you
don’t have such a big house, you needn’t mind, for
you can’t be in more than one room at a time. And
if you don’t have grand dinners, you needn’t mind, for
boys and girls come in only for dessert, and grown-ups
just have indigestion. And if you’ve only one best
frock and one worst one, you needn’t mind, for it will
save the bother of thinking what you’ll put on.’ It
sounds quite sensible, really. I don’t think I do mind
being poor, for myself. Just for Mamma and Austin.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mamma and Austin may learn to be equally
philosophical. At all events, dear, you can go on trying
to show them the bright side of things.”</p>

<p>“If there were a bright side!” said Frances. “I must
try to see it myself first.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I could help you there?” said Muriel,
smiling rather oddly.</p>

<p>“Could you?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;think. Since the sad day of your trial,
dear, which of your friends have been most eager to
seek you out&mdash;which have been careful to hold aloof?”</p>

<p>Muriel watched the changing expression of the girl’s
intelligent face.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Frances at last, in a low, happy voice,
“I know what you mean. Thank you, Miss Carlyon.
Of course you knew, you could not help seeing, how
the girls I used to like the best have seemed, ever
since Christmas, to be far jollier without me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“Only because you made them believe that you
were jollier without them.”</p>

<p>“Did I?” said Frances, with real surprise. “I
thought it was because I was dull and stupid. So I
tried to make friends with the others, but it never
seemed the same. And now all my old chums have
come back to me, and the new ones have stayed away.
Oh, yes, Miss Carlyon, there <i>is</i> a bright side. Only, I
didn’t know where to look for it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the evening of the third day before the one
on which Elveley, and the major portion of its contents,
were to be put up to auction. Mrs. Morland sat
alone in her private sitting-room; a small and
beautifully-furnished apartment where, during the last
weeks, she had hidden herself from all eyes which she
considered malicious or inquisitive. She knew she was
not a popular woman; but she had preferred to mere
popularity the more exclusive gratification which could
be obtained by a determined and successful insistence
on superiority. So long as she could be a leader, Mrs.
Morland cared not whether her train followed her
willingly or not. Thus, among her acquaintances, she
had not tried to make a single friend.</p>

<p>The disaster which would have been heavy to most
women was appalling to her. So far, she had refused
to face facts, and had met her children’s timid protests
either with indifference or anger. But that very afternoon,
the boy and girl&mdash;coming hand in hand, for
mutual encouragement&mdash;had made a fresh attempt to
persuade her to listen to them; and though she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
fairly driven them away by her harsh and bitter
replies, she had not been able to forget the wretchedness
in their young faces. It was true, of course, what
they had said: in three days they would have no roof
to cover their heads.</p>

<p>Austin, on leaving his mother, rushed to the stable,
had his pony saddled, and galloped off to Rowdon.
He had promised that his brother should know that
day how matters stood; and it seemed to Austin that
matters were at desperation-point.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland remained alone. Round her were the
evidences of her lost prosperity, and her eyes roved
from one to another of her possessions, while her brain
worked busily, and her long, slender fingers played
with the pretty toys on a delicately-carved and inlaid
table by her side. The children’s appeal had at last
roused her, and consternation was taking the place of
lethargy. Frances had implored her to speak: but
after all, what could she say? What refuge was open
to her, that pride could let her accept? More than
one of her neighbours&mdash;the Rector first of them&mdash;had
courteously offered her and her children a temporary
home; but the idea of lingering on in Woodend, an
object of careless pity to those whom she had compelled
to a certain admiration, was hateful, even insupportable,
to the suffering woman.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were still dwelling on what seemed
to her an indignity impossible of endurance, when a
servant brought a visitor to her door, and left him, at
his own request, to enter unannounced.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” demanded Mrs. Morland sharply, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
the figure of young Jim Morland began to take shape
in the distant shadows of the room.</p>

<p>Jim stepped forward, and with a word of greeting
quietly proclaimed himself. He had been warned by
Austin of the mood in which he was likely to find his
stepmother; and the latent chivalry of his nature was
now prepared to resist all inclinations towards impatience
or resentment. In Jim’s simple creed a woman’s
misfortune rendered her sacred.</p>

<p>“Please forgive me for venturing, Madam,” began
the lad respectfully; “I’m feared you’ll not be over-pleased
as I should come just now. I’m here because
Austin told me of your trouble, and I wanted to see
what I could do.”</p>

<p>“What you could do!” exclaimed Mrs. Morland,
remembering bitterly enough that her stepson was of
age now; that, had she treated him justly, and made
over to him the share of his father’s property which
was morally his right when he reached his majority,
he would have been able, and probably willing, to
help her to good purpose. “What can you do, pray?
Take my son, and teach him the trade of a blacksmith?”</p>

<p>“He has pluck enough,” replied Jim gently. “And
he would think it no shame to do aught which would
help you or his sister. But of course that’s for me
to do. I am the eldest: and&mdash;though I feel sore-like
to vex you, Madam,&mdash;I’ve come now to claim my
rights.”</p>

<p>“Your rights?” queried Mrs. Morland, thinking of
her husband’s lost thousands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve waited&mdash;knowing as you and Missy
thought shame of me&mdash;to see if you had better plans.
But now I’ve come, because my brother and sister are
in need of someone to care for them.” Jim moved
nearer, and laid his strong brown hand on the dainty
inlaid table: Mrs. Morland almost shivered to see it
there. “I claim the right to care for them. Madam,
this time you can’t say me nay&mdash;it <i>is</i> my right.”</p>

<p>“My good boy,” said Mrs. Morland petulantly, “don’t
try to be bombastic if you want me to hear you out.
Please say what you have come to say, as quickly as
you can.”</p>

<p>“I’d best be quick,” said Jim, unmoved; “for I doubt
not you are tired and worried: and if I could”&mdash;the
lad’s eyes rested softly on his stepmother’s hard-drawn
features&mdash;“I’d like to bring you some ease. You
know as I’ve a little house, Madam. ’Tis a small
place, but tidy-like; and there’s a big orchard behind.
And since my brother and sister must soon
leave their home, I’d have them come to mine and be
king and queen of it. I’d be proud to see them
there.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” said Mrs. Morland grimly; “but the
joys of cottage life are not quite in their line.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Jim earnestly, “you must listen to
me now. The others are too young to do aught, and
it’s not for them to feel the world’s roughness. You
do not like as folks should know their brother’s just a
blacksmith and the home he has to offer them just a
poor cottage. I do not say as that’s not reason in a
way, and no fault of yours. But if, when this place is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
sold, you will not let me take them to Rowdon, where
are they to go?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland sat still awhile, without replying,
while her fingers tapped nervously the polished surface
of the little table. Her demeanour had changed somewhat
during Jim’s brief speech, for she had been
obliged to recognize that his words were the expression
of his heart’s true feeling, and that she had now
no hard or revengeful nature to deal with. However
unworthy might be her estimate of the causes which
prompted Jim’s present attitude, she began to see in
the lad possibilities that would render more tolerable
the necessity for owning him.</p>

<p>“Where are they to go?” asked Jim again, with
increased gentleness.</p>

<p>“They will go with me,” said Mrs. Morland bitterly,
“to the workhouse, I suppose!”</p>

<p>“They will go with you, of course,” said Jim, leaning
forward, and speaking in a tone of the most persuasive
softness his peasant tongue could command. “What
would they do without you? But I’ve a home for you
all at Rowdon&mdash;and&mdash;indeed, I’ll make it as trim as I
can.”</p>

<p>He glanced at the beautiful and costly things about
him, and sighed inwardly. His common-sense taught
him that a woman who had been bred amid such
surroundings could hardly be contented at Rowdon
Smithy. When Jim Morland pressed his invitation
on his stepmother, he guessed that he was passing
sentence on all his future peace of mind. With his
brother and sister alone, he might have hoped, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
day, to be happy: they were very young, and youth
readily accepts its circumstances. Austin, at least,
would quickly have been at home. But Frances!&mdash;Jim
wondered if he could bear the daily sight of his
sister’s shrinking repugnance; and how might he ever
hope to overcome it while Frances remained under the
influence of this suspicious, ungracious nature?</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best,” continued the lad gravely; “and
mayhap Rowdon will serve for a home till I can earn
more and provide a better. Come, then, Madam, if it
please you; and the children will make it home-like.”</p>

<p>The impulse to believe the best of Jim, to give him
the credit of a magnanimous proposal, was stronger
with Mrs. Morland at that moment than she could
have imagined. Some words of acknowledgment were
rising to her lips when her eyes lighted on her stepson’s
rough hand, so near her own delicate fingers, and
in a rapid glance she noted his rustic dress, while her
pride rose passionately at the thought of recognizing
him as a kinsman. Her better instincts were choked
at once by a sensation of overwhelming dislike and
scorn. Mrs. Morland knew that she was ungenerous;
but she easily persuaded herself that, without loss of
self-respect, she could deal to Jim a certain measure
of fairness in compensation for lack of generosity.
He would be satisfied, no doubt, if, in return for the
refuge he offered, she gave him the name but not the
place of a son.</p>

<p>“If I go to Rowdon,” she said deliberately, “you
will, of course, expect me to acknowledge your identity
as my husband’s child?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>Jim flushed deeply: his stepmother’s words contained
a hint of motive on his part which he had a
right to resent.</p>

<p>“I make no bargains, Madam!” said the young
workman sternly. “Come to Rowdon, and call me
what you please.”</p>

<p>“You have claimed your ‘rights’ as a brother,” said
Mrs. Morland, smiling slightly; “and besides, my
friends are, as you know, not so dull as to believe I
should go by choice to live at Rowdon Smithy, or that
you offered me a home there out of pure benevolence.
Perhaps, James,” she continued more seriously, “we
shall understand each other better if we do strike a
bargain. We can put the matter on a business footing
between ourselves, and leave the rest of the world
to supply the sentiment. Well, then, I accept your
offer of a temporary home: in return, I agree to place
in the Rector’s hands a written acknowledgment of
your right to bear your father’s name.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Jim coldly, his patience strained to
the uttermost, “you know right well as I’ve the means
of proving who I am, if so be as I wanted to do it,
without a word from you. ’Twas to save you and
Missy what you held to be shame that I’ve kept so
long a name as was never really my own. There’ll be
no bargaining on my side. Call me East or Morland
as it pleases you; I’ll count your wish as it might be
my father’s, and be your son or not as you choose. I’ll
not presume on your choice either way,” added Jim,
borrowing for once a little of his companion’s bitterness;
“I’m not likely to forget as you’d never give me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
a mother’s love.... I’d not expect it, neither,” he
went on, recovering his softer speech, “no more than I
look for Missy to remember as it’s not my fault I’m
just a rough fellow. The little lad ... the little
lad”&mdash;Jim’s brave voice trembled&mdash;“he’s different: he
sees through things somehow.... Madam,” finished
Jim, looking straight at his stepmother, “I think the
world of the little lad!”</p>

<p>“Boys are so ready to make friends,” said Mrs.
Morland, moved in spite of her prejudices, and striving
to shake off an uncomfortable sense of defeat. “Well,
James, I am not so insensible of your good intentions
as you fancy. I never was quick to give affection, so
you need not take it amiss if I am not demonstrative.
I dare say we shall manage to put up with one
another. Whether as part of a bargain or not, I shall
certainly desire that you be known for the future by
your proper name. And perhaps,” added the speaker,
as the better side of her nature asserted itself, “you
may not despise a different undertaking on my part.
It is unlikely that you and I shall draw together&mdash;there
is no tie of blood to help us, and I frankly confess
to thinking the time too late. But I give you my
promise to do nothing to hinder you from winning
the children’s liking, if it has value in your eyes.”</p>

<p>Jim silently bent his head.</p>

<p>“They are very miserable,” continued Mrs. Morland,
“and you are about to give them some sort of comfort.
Your chance with them ought to be a good one.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather,” said Jim steadily, “as they did not
think of things that way. They’re just children, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
shouldn’t know what trouble means, when there’s
grown folk to save them. Then, will you please tell
them as we’ve arranged?”</p>

<p>“Why not do that yourself?” Mrs. Morland rose,
and her spirits answering to a relief of mind she could
not all at once realize, she moved with her old grace
and dignity towards the door. “Come with me,
James. You shall be introduced as the future head of
the house to your brother and sister. I shall leave
you to give the necessary orders about our movements.
<i>La reine est morte</i>&mdash;that is, she’s going to
retire into private life!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland led the way to the children’s sitting-room;
but only Austin was there. He had lingered,
nervously anxious about the result of Jim’s visit to
Elveley; but Frances had already gone for comfort
and counsel to her friend Miss Carlyon. To Austin
his mother formally announced her decision as to the
future.</p>

<p>“Your brother means to be good to you,” she said,
with an attempt at cheerfulness; “you must try to
thank him better than I have done.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<small>THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It fell to the lot of Austin to tell his sister of Jim’s
plan for their settlement at Rowdon Smithy.
Jim had resolutely declined to wait at Elveley long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
enough to be the bearer of his own news. He was
beset with misgivings as to the results of the course
to which he had persuaded his stepmother to agree;
and yet he knew that by no other means could he
possibly provide, even in the humblest way, for his
kinsfolk.</p>

<p>He had been reared by a masterful, self-contained
man, who had exacted unmurmuring obedience, and
had seldom encouraged individual thought and action.
Thus Jim Morland, at twenty-one, was hardly more
than a boy in essential matters; and the responsibility
of “head of the house”, suddenly thrust on him, was
enough to press heavily on his immature character.
He learned, as time passed, to draw on the fundamental
independence of his nature; but at first he found himself
capable only of doing what lay to his hand&mdash;of
planning as best he might for the present comfort of
his little family, while he trusted that his path might
some day grow less dim.</p>

<p>His interview with Mrs. Morland had been really a
trial to the sensitive, country-bred lad; and he could
not find courage to witness his sister’s reception of the
tidings he supposed would come to her as a fresh
calamity. Jim suffered here for his pardonable moral
cowardice; for even Austin, who knew how Frances
had drooped under the burden of suspense and uncertainty,
was surprised at the relief she showed when
he had explained what lay before her. Frances rose
to the occasion like the plucky lass she always had
tried to be. That very evening she began to work
at the necessary packing; and her mother, hearing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
girl’s cheerful voice when she came for instructions,
felt an unreasonable impatience because what she
would herself so greatly miss seemed to have small
value in her children’s eyes.</p>

<p>Frances was not in the least insensible to the worth
of what she was leaving behind, but out of the depths
of her late despondency it was good to rise to a level
whence she might look bravely and gratefully on the
possibilities of the future. In the first place, she knew
that the question of acknowledging her brother was
at last settled beyond dispute, and that the injustice
done to him was to be removed, however tardily. She
had done nothing to bring this about, and she was
quick to see that atonement on her own part must be
of another sort&mdash;if, indeed, there were any compensation
Jim would care to accept. She could at least
take heed that she did not now mistake her brother’s
motives, or under-estimate the sacrifice he was ready
to make. He had shown himself capable of chivalrous
forgiveness, and the higher part of her nature was
eager to respond.</p>

<p>Frances’s admiration and her longing to make
amends were freely confessed to Muriel Carlyon, who
sympathized with both, and had good counsel to give.</p>

<p>“Don’t overwhelm the boy with formal apologies
and embarrassing praises, dear child. You would only
make him uncomfortable. Try to let him see that you
like and trust him, and want to help him all you can.
It’s no light duty he has undertaken. You, more than
anybody, can make it a pleasant one.”</p>

<p>When Frances came to attempt the putting in practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
of her friend’s advice, she found an obstacle in the
barrier of shyness and constraint which the unlucky
past had raised between her and her elder brother.
Jim was obviously uneasy in her presence&mdash;dreading,
poor fellow, a criticism which he had every reason to
think would be to his disadvantage. He came to
Elveley, during the three days of waiting, as little as
he could; though, as Mrs. Morland seemed determined
to fulfil literally her expressed intention of “retiring
into private life”, he was obliged to act for her at
every point, to give all necessary orders about the
removal, and to interview, as her appointed representative,
all persons who had business with her. Jim
did his utmost; but at Elveley he grew each moment
more weary and dispirited, as he recognized more and
more clearly the difference between the surroundings
to which his stepmother and her children had been
accustomed and those into which he had offered to
take them. He kept his forebodings secret, but they
worried him none the less.</p>

<p>The long-continued trouble had at last brought
Frances one comfort which made amends for everything.
It had given Austin&mdash;the old Austin&mdash;back
to her, and had shown the lad at his best. His
manly instincts had come into evidence, and he had
hovered patiently about his mother and sister, assuring
them that he would soon be grown-up, and able to
work for them. Then they would all be happy again.
Meanwhile&mdash;as growing-up is a slow process&mdash;he was
content to leave to Jim the ordering of affairs. He
knew that he meant from the beginning to do his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
share, but he wisely refrained from informing his
mother that his accomplishment of horse-shoeing was
at length to “come in handy”.</p>

<p>Frances, too, had laid her plans, and meant to be a
busy little housewife. She had confided to Muriel
Carlyon all the doubts and difficulties which had made
her hold aloof from her favourite comrades, even to
the extent of deserting her cherished Society; and now,
feeling that at last she possessed no worrying secrets
and was fairly on the road to recover her self-respect,
Frances rejoiced in the possession of a true friend to
whom she might turn for the encouragement she could
not find at home. On the day before the departure
from Elveley, she paid a “farewell” visit (only Muriel
scouted the word “farewell”) to Woodbank, and entertained
herself and her companion with a discussion of
her coming diversions.</p>

<p>“I am going to be ever so useful,” she announced
blithely. “It wasn’t for nothing, after all, that we
girls started our Club. We’ve learned to cook and to
iron, and I’ve not forgotten your lessons in cutting-out.
I can make my own frocks and things, and the boys’
shirts.&mdash;I call Austin and Jim ‘the boys’,” she went on
with a little flush, “so that I may get used to thinking
of them together.”</p>

<p>“You know where to come for help, darling.”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you. Oh, I’m so glad we’re going to
Rowdon, not to some quite strange place, far away
from you and the girls! Miss Carlyon, we had a little
bit of good news this morning. Mamma’s lawyer wrote
to tell her that the people who have made her sell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
Elveley are going to let her keep some of her favourite
books and pictures and furniture&mdash;anything she likes
up to a certain value&mdash;and some of her glass and
silver. And Austin and I may have all our very own
things: so that Austin is going to take his cameras,
and Jim has promised him a dark-room. That will be
so nice for him, won’t it? He has a fine stock of plates
and chemicals, and we must make them last as long as
we can. They’ll keep a good while. Most of Mamma’s
things were chosen and packed at once, and have gone
away to-day. Austin went with them, to help Jim.”</p>

<p>“You would have known, far better than your
brothers, how to arrange the rooms as your mother
would like best.”</p>

<p>“I shall have some time to-morrow,” said Frances,
colouring. “Mamma will not leave Elveley till the
last thing, but I can go to Rowdon early in the day.”</p>

<p>“And you will go by yourself?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;Florry is coming with me.” Frances admitted
rather awkwardly this evidence of the shy
feeling which made her avoid the sole company of
Jim. “We are going to unpack and put away all the
clothing, and finish Mamma’s sitting-room ready for
her. Jim has been kind about the sitting-room. He
has made Mamma understand that it is to be quite her
own; he has moved out of it the old things which
used to be there, and has put them into the room
opposite, where he keeps all sorts of tools and some
of the materials for his work. I remember very well
when we went to Rowdon Cottage&mdash;that’s what they
call the little house beside the smithy&mdash;Jim’s grandfather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
inviting us to look into ‘Jim’s den’. It was
neat and nice, only it had no proper furniture except
tables and chairs. There were loads of shelves in it.
I do love shelves!”</p>

<p>Muriel Carlyon laughed with pleasure to see the
girl’s cheeks grow pink as she pictured to herself a
real workshop, with entrancing rows of tools, a carpenter’s
bench, apparatus for various kindred handicrafts,
and a floor littered with fresh-smelling shavings
and sawdust.</p>

<p>“It was a jolly ‘den’!” continued Frances; “and if&mdash;if
I do get friends with Jim, I know I shall beg
admittance sometimes to his treasure-chamber. I
shouldn’t wonder if Austin had a corner of it all to
himself. Jim is very fond of Austin. I’m certain he
is, though I’ve hardly seen them together. You could
tell by the way they look at one another.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, you must have a corner of your
mother’s sitting-room.”</p>

<p>Frances shook her head. “Mamma would be miserable
if there were any litter about her, she likes everything
spick and span. And, you know, Austin and I
do want her to be as happy as she can. It is so very,
very dreadful for her&mdash;” Frances paused awkwardly
“I mean, it is dreadful to give up the nice things
she has been used to for such a long time.”</p>

<p>“It is, darling; indeed it is.”</p>

<p>“So I thought if only she could have her own
rooms filled with her own things she might not miss
what she has to leave&mdash;at least, not so much. And
when Jim told her she must count the sitting-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
quite for herself, it did seem possible to make that
pretty. Then the room above it is to be hers too. It
is a pity, but I must take a corner of that. I am
afraid Mamma will dislike sharing her bedroom,
especially as her furniture will fill it up so; but we
can’t help it. There are only four rooms upstairs, and
the two back ones are tiny places, not big enough for
anyone to sleep in. One will be for our boxes, and
the other is full of lumber already. The second bedroom
is for the boys. Austin and I are to have our
own little beds, so they won’t take up much room.”</p>

<p>Muriel listened to all these confidences and to many
more before she allowed Frances to leave her. She
knew that the girl was in real need of a woman’s
sympathy and encouragement, and she hoped by
judicious counsel to make the entry on a new and
strange life a little easier for her favourite. Miss
Carlyon was quite as fond of planning and contriving
as were any of her young folk; she meant to do her
full share in helping forward Frances’s ambitions, and
to see that none of her girls had more of her personal
help and affection than the lass who was so ready and
eager to conquer fate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The lights in Rowdon Cottage burned throughout
that last night of Jim Morland’s solitary life. The
hours of dusk and darkness and dawning were few
and short to the busy lad, who worked steadily and
with intention during every moment they gave him.
Jim’s eyes were already fairly-well opened to the
nature of the burden he had taken on his young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
shoulders. He had accepted in a spirit Mrs. Morland
had not dreamed of, her injunction that he should
consider himself the head of the little family.</p>

<p>He knew that he must be, first of all, the bread-winner.
Jim’s calculations as to ways and means
were already completed, and he had reckoned up the
average of his earnings, added the result to the sum
which came to him from the provision made by his
grandfather, and decided that he might count on a
weekly income of thirty-five shillings.</p>

<p>Jim was not ignorant enough to suppose that this
amount could allow for any save the simplest methods
of housekeeping, even when supplemented by garden
produce and home-reared poultry. The old woman
who did his cooking and housework expected only a
small wage, but this, and her food, made a serious item
of expenditure; and poor Jim wondered anxiously
whether her blundering ways would be tolerated by
his fastidious stepmother. Jim was not prone to hard
judgments, but he was not a fool; and he had seen
that Mrs. Morland could be both unjust and unreasonable.
He knew, only too surely, how Frances had
shrunk from contact with himself; and argued that
she would be predisposed to despise his cottage
home.</p>

<p>The lad grew hot and cold by turns as he anticipated
his inability to satisfy their expectations; and
at last came to the wise decision that he would, at
the outset, make confession of his modest means, and
avoid the worse pain of raising hopes he could not
fulfil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“For I must not run into debt,” pondered Jim. “I
promised grandfather I never would do that.”</p>

<p>Even without the remembered promise to admonish
him, Jim was not cast in the mould of those people
who can look their just creditors unblushingly in the
face.</p>

<p>When morning brought his elderly housekeeper, the
lad nerved himself for an ordeal. This was no less a
matter than an important parley with old Elizabeth
Macbean. Elizabeth was a Scotswoman, and an excellent
domestic according to her lights; but her gaunt,
angular person and strong-featured countenance were
not prepossessing, and Jim was nervously anxious lest
she should give offence by her independent speech
and manners. To old East and his grandson her
civility had never fallen short; she had looked on
them as her superiors simply because they employed
her, and she had even shown a kind of motherly
interest in her younger master. But Jim recollected
that Elizabeth had heard with compressed lips and
scowling brow the facts he had found it necessary to
tell her about the changed affairs of Rowdon Cottage;
so he was not without qualms as he prepared to add to
his news at this latest possible moment. His gentle
nature made him shrink from inflicting pain, and he
feared he was about to hurt well-meaning old Elizabeth.
Fortunately, Jim had no mixed notions on the
score of duty; and it seemed to him now that his duty
was plain.</p>

<p>He left Elizabeth to go about her morning work as
usual, and was careful to do justice to the simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
breakfast prepared for him. Home-baked scones and
new-laid eggs were excellent fare in Jim’s opinion;
and he rose from the table refreshed and strengthened
in spite of his long night of toil.</p>

<p>“I don’t think as anything could be better than
your scones, Elizabeth,” said Jim, from a discreet post
at the kitchen door. “You’ll let me have some every
day when the children come, won’t you? I’m sure
they’ll like your scones, Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see what I can dae. Whiles they have nae
butter-milk up at the fairm.”</p>

<p>The tone of Mrs. Macbean’s voice was not promising,
and her attitude, as, shovel in hand, she “made up”
her fire, was positively militant. Jim drew on his
reserve fund of determination and stood his ground.</p>

<p>“Well, can you spare a moment, Elizabeth? I have
something to tell you.”</p>

<p>“I hae thocht that,” replied Mrs. Macbean, with
disconcerting promptitude.</p>

<p>“And I hope you won’t take it unkind,” added Jim.</p>

<p>“I’ll mak nae promises,” snapped Elizabeth.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="i-197" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-197.png" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>M432</p>
<p class="center">“NAY, ELIZABETH,” SAID JIM KINDLY, “THERE’S NO NEED FOR
LOCKING UP.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Anyway, I must say it,” continued the lad gravely.
“You know, Elizabeth, as there’s ladies coming here
to-day. I’ve told you all about it, and how, though
they’re my very own folk (Jim held his head proudly),
they’ve been brought up different. I’m wanting, most
of all, as they shall feel this cottage home-like, and so
I’d not have them miss, more than I can help, all
they’ve had to give up. You’ve always managed for
grandfather and me, Elizabeth; and you’ve served us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>faithful, as I’ll never forget. But when my stepmother
and my half-sister come (Jim was faithfully
exact), they’ll be mistresses here. I want you to go to
one of them every day for orders, and do your best to
please them.”</p>

<p>Jim held his breath.</p>

<p>“Jist as ye please, sir,” was the sole response of
Elizabeth; and thrusting one hand deeply into a
serviceable pocket, she dragged out, with ostentatious
indifference, a small bunch of keys, and flung them
clatteringly on to the kitchen-table.</p>

<p>“Nay, Elizabeth,” said Jim kindly, “there’s no need
for locking up, and I’m sure the ladies won’t wish it.
Keep the keys, and give me your promise as you’ll
help me all you can. I’m a bit worried and sore-hearted,
Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“There’s nae doot aboot that,” returned the old
dame, though evidently mollified. “I hae watched
ye ever since ye telt me o’ the happenings at the
grand hoose yonder, where your fine leddy mither
and sister wear their silks an’ satins; and I hae seen
the speirit gang oot o’ ye. But I’ll dae your wull,
maister.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be all right, then, Elizabeth,” said Jim,
sighing in relief of spirit. “You’ve made the cottage
beautiful clean and fresh-like, and I’m sure you’ll
keep things nice.”</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Macbean uplifted her long person after a
final dash at the coals, and emphasized her speech
with her loaded shovel.</p>

<p>“I hae served gentlefolk afore,” she remarked
grimly; “and I’m no needin’ tellin’ as to hoo I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
serve them the noo. There’s ae thing mair. I hae
kent, lang afore ye hae telt me onything, Maister Jim,
that ye were come o’ gentle folk yersel. Ye hae a’
the look o’ it; and I’m thinkin’ it’s a peety.”</p>

<p>With these uncompromising words, Mrs. Macbean
flung the contents of her shovel on the fire, snatched
up a broom, and vanished through the back door.
Jim sighed again, and went off to give the rooms
a final inspection. His last visit was to the “den”
of which Frances had told Miss Carlyon. Thence he
emerged with a strange glimmer of a smile on his lips.</p>

<p>As he stepped to the threshold of the front door,
which stood wide open to the warm August airs, he
saw a sight which made him halt irresolutely, while
his pulses throbbed in sheer nervous excitement.</p>

<p>A couple of girls had just reached the gate, and
were pacing slowly up the path between the glowing
flower-beds: as they came, they pointed out eagerly
to one another old favourites they could recognize
among the cared-for luxuriance of the borders.</p>

<p>“See!” said the sweet, clear voice of Frances, “isn’t
that a splendid clump of southernwood? And those
deep purple pansies&mdash;I love them!”</p>

<p>Jim caught his breath sharply. If Frances could
“love” anything about Rowdon!</p>

<p>“What darling snapdragons&mdash;white and yellow and
red!”</p>

<p>“And those briar roses&mdash;aren’t they late?”</p>

<p>The girls bent low to enjoy the varied fragrance.
Jim felt something in his throat, and for a moment
saw the pretty girlish figures through a mist. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
sudden access of joy filled his heart. Could it be that
his home was to know the familiar presence of such
as these? Could anything he had to offer be worthy
of their soft eyes and dainty hands? He gazed, in a
happiness he could not have explained, at the gracious
picture before him. Only a pair of charming English
lassies; but for simple Jim they were an inspiration
to love all that was highest, purest, worthiest.</p>

<p>Florry Fane lifted her head, and caught sight of
Frances’s “blacksmith-brother”. Florry did not keep
her intellect for book-studies, and she called on it now
to help the situation.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” she exclaimed merrily, “there’s Jim! I
shall run and ask him to tell me the name of that
pretty blue flower!”</p>

<p>She hurried on, and before Frances could overtake
her had gained the porch, and held out her hand to
Jim, who stood waiting there.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Morland!” said Florry, in gay
greeting; “we’ve come to make ourselves tremendously
useful. We’ve great big aprons in this bag,
and Austin has lent us a hammer and a packet of
nails. We mean business, you see.”</p>

<p>Jim took the kind little hand, and bade Florry
welcome with most respectful courtesy. It was good
of her to call him by his father’s name; but, being
Frances’s friend, she was, of course, a queen among
girls.</p>

<p>Frances came up, and finding the ice thus broken,
managed to greet Jim easily enough. The three
talked for a few moments in the porch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“Now we must go in and set to work,” declared
Florry presently; and Jim stood aside that she might
lead the way; then, as Frances made a shy motion to
follow, he detained his sister by a slight gesture.</p>

<p>“I hope as you’ll find things right, Missy,” said the
youth in a low voice. “I’ve a lot of work to do in the
smithy yonder, and I’ll be there all day most like.
Elizabeth will bring me something to eat; and so&mdash;so&mdash;the
place’ll be clear, if you and Miss Fane wish to
stay. I bade Elizabeth ask what you’d fancy,”&mdash;Jim
coloured, and added with some effort,&mdash;“and you won’t
forget, Missy, as you’re mistress here.”</p>

<p>Frances wanted to say something kind and appreciative;
but while she watched her brother’s nervousness
her own came back to her, and she searched
vainly for words which might make an approach to
frank confidence between them seem possible. Jim
saw only her hesitation, and hastily concluding that
his forebodings had been justified, stepped quietly out
of the porch and took the side-path to the smithy.</p>

<p>“I believe it will always be like this,” thought
Frances, as she gazed remorsefully after her brother’s
tall, well set-up figure. “I wonder why I’m such a
silly? I wish he wouldn’t call me ‘Missy’. I wish I
could tell him nicely&mdash;so that he wouldn’t be vexed&mdash;that
he ought to say ‘Frances’, as Austin does. Austin
would know how to do it, but that’s because he behaved
kindly and fairly and has nothing to be
ashamed of. And Jim has been so good to us, so
generous and forgiving; I ought to be proud of him&mdash;and
I think I am, deep down in my heart. It’s the top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
part of me that’s so ungracious and horrid. How
stupid to be shy, when he’s my own brother! Shall
I ever be sensible about it?”</p>

<p>Just as Frances reached this plaintive speculation
her friend’s patience gave way, and Florry, who had
ventured on a peep into the sitting-room, came back
to fetch the loiterer.</p>

<p>“It looks quite nice already,” said Florry cheerfully.
“There really isn’t much for us to do, except the
‘etceteras’.” She dragged Frances forcibly into Mrs.
Morland’s future sanctum. “See! even the curtains
have been put up; and don’t they hang nicely? One
of your brothers has ideas, Frances! I wonder which
of them ‘disposed’ that drapery?”</p>

<p>“Not Austin; he wouldn’t be bothered!” laughed
Frances. “The room does look pretty. Those soft
gray walls are such a nice background for the pictures.
It was kind of the creditor-people to let Mamma keep
some of her pictures and china, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Florry soberly. “But as your
mother wasn’t really a bit to blame&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t! Miss Carlyon says the more I ‘nurse a
grievance’ the worse things will seem. I’m certain
she’s right; for I begin to feel my ‘angry passions
rise’ the moment I give them a chance.”</p>

<p>“Come, then&mdash;to business! Here are two suggestive-looking
boxes already unfastened for us. What lurks
within, fellow-conspirator?”</p>

<p>“Nothing very mysterious. Only a few special
treasures of Mamma’s, and some of her books, and
other odds and ends. There’s the empty book-case in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
that corner. Good Austin! He has remembered to put
up the brackets and small shelves for the china.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a pretty little overmantel? I don’t
recollect seeing it at Elveley. What dainty carving!”</p>

<p>“It never was at Elveley,” said Frances, in a puzzled
voice; “and it is pretty. Those two long shelves will
be lovely for photographs and the little figures papa
brought from India. Oh! the overmantel is a blessing.
Let’s make haste to fill it.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I’ll do the books, and leave you the treasures.
Ah, what a jolly Browning! Isn’t this binding perfect?
Hallo! it’s Rivière’s! Frances, you’re a lucky
girl. It ought to make you amiable to live with this.”</p>

<p>“Goose! I like a binding I can handle. I wouldn’t
give my own Browning for that; though I own that
Rivière, like our unknown genius of the curtains, has
‘ideas’.”</p>

<p>“Here’s an edition of Jane Austen in crimson
morocco. Frances, I wouldn’t have Jane Austen in
crimson. She ought to be bound in French gray, or
‘puce’, or anything old-fashioned and sweet. Never
mind; here she goes, dear old thing! When we’ve
finished with this room, Francy, do let’s unpack your
treasures. I helped you to pack them, so I shall
know just where everything is.”</p>

<p>Frances shook her head. “I told Austin to send my
boxes to the little place upstairs. There’s no room for
their contents anywhere.”</p>

<p>Florry looked unmistakably crestfallen.</p>

<p>“You see, this is the only sitting-room besides Jim’s
den,” continued Frances hastily; “and Mamma and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
have to share a bedroom. I’ve been wondering where
I shall pop my mammoth work-basket.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Frances! Your beautiful Altruist basket!”
Florry saw her friend wince, and, running across the
room, threw her arms about the other lassie and
hugged her close. “Come back to us, Francy dear!
oh, do! You were the first Altruist, and the best&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah, no, no!” cried Frances, with a tremble in her
voice; “I was just a great humbug&mdash;a mean pretender!”</p>

<p>“You never were. You started it all; and, Frances,
it has been of some use to Woodend. The Rector says
so, and Mr. Carlyon, and Dr. Brenton, and&mdash;Max. If
Max says so&mdash;who would dispute Max? Francy, all
the girls and boys want you to come back.”</p>

<p>“I can’t till I’m gooder,” said Frances, wavering between
sobs and smiles. “I’m a shabby, horrid thing!
Florry, don’t let’s talk of those jolly old times&mdash;before
last Christmas. See! I’m going to work hard. I won’t
say another word till I’ve finished.”</p>

<p>Florry could both see and hear that the resolve was
a wise one; so she went sedately back to her books,
and was in the thick of “business” when the sitting-room
door was pushed open and Mrs. Macbean entered.</p>

<p>The girls at once greeted the old woman,&mdash;whom
they had seen more than once when they had paid
holiday visits to the smithy,&mdash;with a pleasant word
and smile.</p>

<p>“I hae made a bit dinner for ye, Missies,” said
Elizabeth, striving after the manners she considered
due to gentlefolk, “and I hae pit doon the table-claith,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
as the maister’s bidding was, in the room on
the ither side o’ the passage. Maybe ye’ll ring the
bell yonder when ye’re minded for me to serve ye.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Elizabeth, you are good!” said Frances gratefully.
“We meant to go home for dinner; but it is a
long way, isn’t it, Florry?”</p>

<p>“Rather! And we’ve such lots to do. Elizabeth&mdash;best
of Elizabeths!&mdash;do say we are to have some of
those delicious scones you brought to us once when we
came here to plague you!”</p>

<p>“Surely ye’ll no be minding on my bits o’ scones,
Missy?” inquired Mrs. Macbean graciously. “The
likes o’ you lassies I never did see! Weel, I’ve nae
doot I can obleege ye; and ye’ll likely no refuse a
whang o’ the cream cheese that the fairm-wife sent
till the maister this morning. Come awa’ wi’ ye,
Missies, ben the ither room, and I’ll bring the dishes
in. It’s one o’clock&mdash;late eneuch for bairns.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth bustled away, secretly well pleased that it
was once more her lot to wait on gentlefolk. Perhaps
there was in the peasant woman’s nature a strain of
sympathy which, if it made her jealous for her
“maister’s” rights and dignity, was no less capable of
appreciating the trouble which had fallen on Jim’s
“fine leddy mither and sister”.</p>

<p>The girls ran upstairs to wash their dusty hands,
and chased each other down again amid peals of
laughter, which brought indulgent smiles to Mrs. Macbean’s
face and sent her with good-will to her serving.</p>

<p>“Fancy dining in Jim’s den!” laughed Frances,
pausing at the door. “We shall need to use the sitting-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
for meals, I suppose, when we’ve a proper table
there. I’m glad we’re going in here to-day. It’s a
lovely place, Florry,&mdash;all shelves and saw-dust, and
dear little saws and hammers and things. Don’t you
like a carpenter’s shop? I do. I always envied the
boy Altruists&mdash;”</p>

<p>Frances, having by this time led the way into “Jim’s
den”, stood just beyond the threshold, too absolutely
surprised at what she now saw to remember after
what fashion she had envied the boys. The room had
undergone a transformation. The walls had been
freshly covered with a pretty paper; the wide, latticed
windows had been hung with dainty Madras muslin,
with sage-green draperies at either side to be drawn
across at night. The carpet was of the same soft tint,
and so were the furnishings of two or three wicker
chairs placed at cosy points. The deep window-seat
held a couple of big cushions of yellow silk, and was
thickly padded, and covered to match the chairs. On
a table close to the window stood the Altruist work-basket.
Most of the shelves which Frances had
admired still ran along the walls, and on them were
neatly ranged, not the paraphernalia of handicrafts,
but the many special possessions of Frances and Austin.
Their own treasured volumes filled two plain book-cases,
whence had been banished the hoarded sum of
Jim’s library.</p>

<p>Before her eyes had taken in half the details,
Frances turned to Florry and exclaimed impetuously:
“Oh, what made him do this? How could he? Jim
has given up his den to us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“He is a brick!” said Florry heartily. “Now you
know where your things are going, Frances. I believe
they are all here. There’s your mother’s Christmas
present”&mdash;Florry pointed to the desk on a side-table
spread with the children’s writing materials. “There’s
your easel, and your paint-boxes are on the shelf close
at hand. What’s behind that inviting-looking curtain
hung between those two shelves?”</p>

<p>“Austin’s photographic things,” replied Frances,
peeping; “here are his cameras, plates, papers, chemicals,
and everything. He is to use the bath-room for
developing; he has been covering the window with
red stuff. Fancy a bath-room in a cottage like this!
Jim’s grandfather built it out at the back.”</p>

<p>“Austin will be very much obliged to him.”</p>

<p>“Florry,” said Frances, a troubled look in her eyes,
“I don’t think Austin and I ought to take this room
from Jim. He cannot possibly have anywhere else to
go. I think I will just find my way to the smithy
this very moment, and talk to him about it.”</p>

<p>“Good!” returned Florry equably; “I will e’en to that
cosy window-seat and watch for your return.”</p>

<p>Frances departed in a hurry for fear of failing
courage; and Florry, who had something to say, but
was in no haste to say it, carried a book to the window
and felt herself at home.</p>

<p>Jim stood by his anvil, making, with level, well-aimed
blows, rough nails for farmers’ use. He had flung off
his coat and waistcoat, rolled up his sleeves, and donned
a leathern apron. It was Jim the blacksmith on whose
hardy toil Frances cast shy and interested eyes. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
did not look so unapproachable as she had expected;
but it was evident that her coming had startled him.
The lad laid down his hammer, however, and stepped
forward at once.</p>

<p>“You want me, Missy?” he said quickly, with an
undefined hope that his sister might be about to
command his willing service.</p>

<p>“Oh no!” said Frances; “I didn’t mean to interrupt
you&mdash;at least, only for a minute. I came to say that&mdash;that
Florry and I have been looking at your
room&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jim was hungering for a word of satisfaction. If,
indeed, he had pleased Frances, surely he might dare
to hope that he had not begun amiss.</p>

<p>“You used to have so many things there,” continued
Frances, her self-possession deserting her as she noted
the expression of her brother’s grave young face. “I
don’t think Austin and I ought to be so much in
your way.”</p>

<p>“You could never be that, Missy,” said Jim, whose
spirits sank unaccountably at the painful courtesy of
Frances’s manner. “It’ll be right for you to have a
little place where you’ll feel private-like, and know
as nobody will interfere.”</p>

<p>“You are kind, Jim,” said Frances; and the girl
hung her head in shame that no warmer words would
come at her bidding.</p>

<p>“Surely not,” said Jim dejectedly. “There’s no talk
of kindness so long as I can do aught&mdash;” Jim hesitated,
fearing to offend by some obtrusively brother-like
speech, and his pleading glance fell at the sight of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
Frances’s averted head. “There, Missy,” he continued
gently; “don’t you go for to trouble yourself about
my bits of things. I’ve a deal more room for them
in the big shed behind here; and they’ll be handier
to get at. You’ve no call to think twice of them.”</p>

<p>Then Frances stepped close, and laid her hand on
Jim’s arm.</p>

<p>“You are kind&mdash;and good,” she said earnestly. “I
don’t know why you should take us in here, and
bother about us at all.”</p>

<p>“Don’t, Missy!” murmured Jim, keenly wounded.
“Who should care for you and the little lad, if not
me?”</p>

<p>“Nobody would, Jim; nobody. And I don’t see
why you should. But indeed I do want to help, and
to share the work all I can. I shall soon find out&mdash;and
I’ll beg Elizabeth to teach me.”</p>

<p>“No!&mdash;no!” Jim was touched at his tenderest
point. “You’ll do naught here but what pleases you,
Missy. ’Tis for men to work and make beautiful
homes for their lady-folk.”</p>

<p>“Girls work now as well as boys, Jim,” returned
Frances rather wistfully. She had been wont to
dream of the life-work which should be hers some
day&mdash;of voluntary, altruistic toil among the poor and
suffering of the great city; not of humdrum daily
tasks which could claim no more fascinating name
than the prosaic one of duty.</p>

<p>“I cannot see as that’s right, Missy,” said Jim; and
Frances looked with a certain pity at this lad born
out of due time&mdash;this old-fashioned believer in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
right of woman to be worked for, and set apart and
worshipped. If he could have heard Miss Cliveden’s
impassioned voice as she urged her pupils to remember
their sacred claim to share with men the glorious task
of making history!</p>

<p>Jim was utterly out of date. He bent his head and
kissed reverently the little fingers resting on his arm;
then caught up his hammer and began afresh to work
for his “lady-folk” with all his peasant might.</p>

<p>Frances went slowly back to her comrade.</p>

<p>“Jim will make us keep the room,” said the girl
with conviction; “and I do not believe I even thanked
him properly.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry him with gratitude,” remarked
Florry the philosopher. “I would just clear a corner
for him and ask him to occupy it. I fancy he would
like that better than thankings.”</p>

<small>A GENTLEMAN-BLACKSMITH.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The energy of the Altruists languished a good deal
during the long summer vacation. Edward and
Muriel Carlyon went on a six-weeks’ visit to a relative
in the north, and enjoyed themselves mightily after a
year of hard work. Edward’s black coat did not
hinder him from tasting the happiness peculiar to the
sportsman-naturalist; and Muriel’s governessing had
not taken the charm from her tramps through heather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
and bracken. A good many of the younger Altruists
were off to the seaside: those that remained in Woodend
voted it ridiculous to attend meetings over which
there was nobody in particular to preside.</p>

<p>Florry Fane received a long-hoped-for invitation
to visit an aunt who had settled in Normandy, whence
she was in the habit of making frequent excursions to
continental cities. The chance of seeing Paris, Rome,
and Florence was suddenly flashed before Florry’s
dazed eyes, and her parents prepared to miss for a
couple of months, at least, the light of their quiet
home. Frances Morland did not learn till long afterwards
that Florry had turned resolutely from the
offered treat because she would not leave her friend in
the hour of trouble.</p>

<p>“Paris must wait,” said Florry, “till Frances is
happy again.”</p>

<p>The self-denying little Altruist proved that no
meetings were necessary to hold her to the accepted
motto of her Society. Hardly a day passed without
the appearance at Rowdon of her bright face and
helpful hands. Jim’s heart grew lighter directly he
heard “Miss Fane’s” voice. It was good to hear for
its own sake, and then it meant the best of comradeship
for Frances.</p>

<p>The Society sent another delegate to do its work at
the smithy. Max and Florry frequently travelled the
three miles together, arguing as they went with a
vivacity learned at the school “symposia”. They
never convinced one another, but it was all the better
to be able to look forward to a fresh bout of disagreeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
next time. Sometimes they walked, sometimes
they rode with a friendly farmer or begged a lift in
the Doctor’s trap. Journey as they might, they always
turned up smiling, contented, and in hot dispute.</p>

<p>It was Max’s fair season at Woodend; the season
when his many public concerns made least demand on
him, and he was most free to remember private interests.
His invalids were at their best; his poor folk
were recovering from the effects of the burning heat
in their stuffy rooms, and were still independent of
warm clothing. Moreover, a wealthy valetudinarian
had bought Elveley, and was demanding a daily visit
from Dr. Brenton. Max ventured to anticipate the
consequent fees, and on his own responsibility borrowed
from the “Examinations” fund the wherewithal
to present the dog-cart with a new rug and its owner
with a new overcoat. Dr. Brenton retaliated by ordering
for Max a trim Eton suit&mdash;challenging the chancellor
of the exchequer to refuse to pay for it, and in
so doing to ruin his father’s credit. Then the unconventional
pair attired themselves festively, and beamed
at each other in the joy of their reciprocal liberality.</p>

<p>Max and Austin were always merry at the smithy,
and they did their best to make Jim merry likewise.
With fervent good-will they wielded the hammer, and
smote the anvil, and practised horse-shoeing until their
teacher pronounced them adepts. Sometimes they
dragged Jim off to the common, where they had cut
and rolled a decent pitch for their cricket. Jim could
play, of course, but his science was behind theirs. It
seemed to the boys a fair return for lessons in horse-shoeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
when their hints, added to natural quickness
of eye and hand, had made of Jim a most respectable
bowler.</p>

<p>The Morland family had by this time fairly settled
at Rowdon, and accepted, after their varying fashion,
the fresh order of their lives. The first excitement of
change and bustle was over, and with it had gone the
impression of relief from pressing disaster, as well as
the sense of unrest and adventure which had served
to dispel fruitless broodings and cast a glamour of
romance over the new cottage-home. Frances and
Austin were too busy and too active to sink back into
despondency; but their mother suffered acutely&mdash;all
the more acutely because she shut herself and her
gloom out of the reach of the kindliest sympathizers.</p>

<p>Loneliness and misery rendered her harsh and intolerant
to the youngsters who longed to comfort her.
She was irritated by seeing her own children seemingly
happy and contented, and by witnessing the small
<i>gaucheries</i> of her stepson’s harmless rusticity. Jim,
better able than the younger ones to understand her
condition, bore her sharp reproofs and covert sneers
with determined self-control. They hurt him none
the less; and he suspected that he was despised for
the very efforts after a dutiful bearing which cost
him so much: but he never had cherished any hope
of pleasing or satisfying his stepmother, and was
grateful that she kept her promise of not intervening
between him and his brother and sister.</p>

<p>It was true that she had not much opportunity of
doing so, for the three young people were seldom together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Frances found plenty of ways in which she
could help Elizabeth; who was willing to be relieved
of lighter duties, though she would not for worlds
have allowed her young mistress to do anything she
could make time to do herself. Then there were
studies to be kept up, books to be read on the recommendation
of Miss Carlyon or Florry, old friends
to be visited in spare hours, and the family mending
to be attended to.</p>

<p>Jim was an excellent craftsman, as his neighbours
had soon discovered; but working alone, and with only
the simplest appliances, he could not attempt the
higher branches of a smith’s trade. He had constant
employment, but no greater returns than any other
skilled artisan could depend on; and after the first
month of his new life had gone by he began to be
tormented by anxiety as to ways and means. Part of
his weekly income came from his small invested
capital, and on the latter he soon found he must draw
to meet household expenses. This meant, by and by,
a reduction on the interest paid to him in consideration
of his grandfather’s savings, and a consequent
lessening of his resources.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Morland had first come to Rowdon, he
had told her frankly the amount of his income, and
had suggested that she should have control over it and
make the housekeeping her own charge. Most women
would have been touched by the offer, which was
surely honourable to the lad who made it.</p>

<p>“My good boy,” replied Mrs. Morland, “you really
must excuse me from undertaking the management of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
your house and the responsibility of your wealth. I
have never learned how to spend pennies, and I have
no idea when porridge and herrings are in season. I
might order by mistake a halfpenny-worth too much
milk, and then where would you be? No, believe
me, you will manage far better yourself. Or stay, it
might amuse Frances to play with sixpences, and she
is terribly conscientious. No doubt she would calculate
the required milk to a drop. I have always felt
sure she had a genius for figures, since she told me she
“kept the accounts” of that funny little Society she
started and got tired of. Children always get tired
of everything; but Frances might find housekeeping
quite a pleasant entertainment for a time. Go and
ask her, James. And do try to avoid grimacing. It
makes me quite uncomfortable to see that frowning
brow and those tightly-drawn lips. So like some
melodramatic, middle-class novel. Run away, boy.
Ta-ta.”</p>

<p>Jim’s courage, after this rebuff, was not equal to the
task of approaching Frances, and his sister would
have heard nothing of the interview if Mrs. Morland
had not diverted herself by giving Frances a special
version of it. The girl listened in silence, and with
half-acknowledged regret on Jim’s behalf. Frances
felt instinctively that Jim had made an honest advance,
and that he had been unworthily answered.</p>

<p>She was sorry that time did not prove correct her
mother’s prophecy that her brother would come to her
next; and she debated anxiously with herself whether
he would be vexed if she were to offer to try her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
prentice hand at the ordering of the cottage affairs.
Jim had certainly invited her to remember that she
was “mistress” at Rowdon; there could be no undaughterly
presumption in filling the place her mother
had refused.</p>

<p>Frances decided that Jim had better be the one to
open the question; but Jim held his tongue, and bore
his own burdens. He had been accustomed to leave
the provisioning of his little household to Elizabeth,
and to pay the weekly bills without investigation.
Now he found that he must not only investigate, but
urge on Mrs. Macbean the strictest economy. Even
then, as has been said, his income must be supplemented
somehow.</p>

<p>Further, the lad worried himself about the arrested
education of his young brother and sister. At first it
was undivided happiness to have Austin so constantly
at his side, and to catch glimpses of Frances tending
the flowers or feeding the chickens. But when he
found his brother obstinately determined to help in
the smithy, and discovered that his sister actually
made beds and dusted rooms, he began to accuse himself
of grossly neglected duties.</p>

<p>Edward and Muriel Carlyon had sought out Mrs.
Morland on their return home, and had begged her in
most tactful fashion to let them keep their two pupils
without payment of school-fees. Mrs. Morland’s pride
had not been sufficient to render her quite blind to
the value of the opportunity; but she had tried to
save her self-esteem by leaving the matter for the
children’s own settlement. Austin and Frances were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
not blind either, and they saw more clearly now than
before what a good education might mean to them.
They had talked the subject over together, they had
invited the counsel of Florry and Max. It was significant
that they did not seek their mother’s advice.
Finally, they went to Woodbank in company, and
put their concerns bravely and fully before their two
kindly friends and teachers.</p>

<p>Frances and Austin did not go back to school, but
they went twice a week to Woodbank for private
lessons in modern languages, classics, and mathematics,
and studied at home between whiles. Every evening
they spent at least a couple of hours over their books,
and found chances for music and drawing as best they
could in the daytime.</p>

<p>It was this custom which led, one evening in
November, to an unexpected development in the
quiet life of Rowdon Cottage. The boy and girl
(Austin being the chief spokesman) had persuaded
Jim that they would not accept sole rights in his old
“den”. He must spend there his few hours of leisure,
and a book-case brought from Elveley should be consecrated
to his library. Jim at first availed himself
but sparingly of his opportunities. Usually he
worked all the early part of the evening in the smithy
or the shed, and later on disappeared into the little
lumber attic where he had disposed the tools and
materials for his wood-carving. But sometimes he
would slip quietly into the children’s room&mdash;the study,
as they chose to call it,&mdash;and after a respectful, interested
glance at the pair of young students seated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
opposite one another, with the shaded lamp between
them, at the round table, would take a book from his
shelf and try to remember that he was one of the
family.</p>

<p>On the evening in question, Frances had noticed
that Jim had betaken himself to his own corner
with a volume which she had seen with some surprise
to be Green’s <i>Short History of the English
People</i>. The lad read steadily for an hour or so, and
Frances, each time she looked up, saw that his attention
was firmly fixed on the page. But presently Jim
leaned back in his chair, his book rested on his knee,
and his eyes were turned towards the round table with
an expression which his sister found uncomfortably
suggestive of some latent longing. She hesitated for
a moment, and then said diffidently:</p>

<p>“Don’t you like your book, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’ve finished it, thank you, Missy.”</p>

<p>Jim had not learned to say “Frances”; but “Missy”,
as he pronounced it, had the accents of a pet-name,
and his sister had ceased to find fault with it.</p>

<p>“Fancy! You must read fast. Can you remember
all those names and things? I do think it’s difficult.”</p>

<p>“I’ve read this book three times,” said Jim gently.
He had read, ever since he could remember, all the
historical works he could get hold of. “I ought to
remember it now, Missy.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to?” asked Frances curiously.</p>

<p>“Ay&mdash;surely. Else, what good to be an Englishman?”</p>

<p>“Jim,” began Frances after anxious cogitation, “would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
you like&mdash;would you care&mdash;to study with Austin and
me?” The girl flushed a little as she went on hurriedly:
“There are heaps of things I dare say you know far
more about than we do; but there are some ... and
Papa would have liked....”</p>

<p>Poor Frances stopped in awkward fear of hurting
the lowly-reared brother.</p>

<p>She need not have paused. The words were hardly
spoken when Jim’s face lighted up with eager pleasure.</p>

<p>“Missy&mdash;I’d love it! Oh, would you&mdash;could you&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Of course we could,” interrupted Austin with a
merry laugh. “Jim, old man, you are an eccentric.
Fancy meeting a fellow who needn’t stew at lessons,
and actually wants to! Come to the table this very
minute!” Austin flew to drag up a third chair
and force Jim into it. “Now then, what’s it to be
first&mdash;classics or mathematics?”</p>

<p>“Austin, don’t worry, dear,” said Frances, seeing
that Jim’s breath came fast from the excitement of
what was to him a momentous opportunity. “Tell
Jim the lessons we have at Woodbank, then he can
choose what he would like best.”</p>

<p>Then Jim seized his chance and spoke.</p>

<p>“I’d like best to learn to speak right, Missy,” said
the youth earnestly; “so as you’d have no need, some
day, to feel shame of me.”</p>

<p>It was a hard thing to say, but Jim got through it.</p>

<p>Frances was on the point of disclaiming vehemently.
She was checked by the certainty that her brother
would not believe her. Had she not long ago proved
him right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“Humph!” said Austin, again filling the breach;
“that’s in your line, Sis. ‘Grammar and Analysis’,
and all that twaddle. I hate the stuff.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” agreed Frances quickly, “Jim and I
will study subjects and objects; and you’ll see, sir, <i>my</i>
pupil won’t hate them.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll see, miss, that <i>my</i> pupil will cross the
<i>Pons Asinorum</i> with a leap and a bound.”</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> pupil will read Latin without a crib.”</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> pupil will parley-voo frangsay like a gay
moonseer.”</p>

<p>“You ridiculous boy!”</p>

<p>“You cockaleekie girl!”</p>

<p>Austin flung his arm round his brother’s shoulders
and hugged them with a will.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind us, Jim,” he said. “We must lark
a bit, and so must you. We’ll be awful strict teachers,
and give you a hundred lines every time you miss a
question. But you may wink one eye between whiles.”</p>

<p>Austin’s mirth drowned Jim’s attempted thanks.
But the younger boy suddenly became sober, and
thrusting his Euclid under Jim’s eyes, entered on a
careful explanation of certain well-known axioms
necessary to the comprehension of the First Proposition.
Then Frances delivered a lucid lecture on the
Nominative Case. Finally, Jim carried off a couple
of lesson-books to his corner, and set to work to
recall half-forgotten rudiments learned long ago at
elementary schools, and to assure himself that he never
would disgrace the pair of accomplished scholars he
had left at the round table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>Elizabeth kept a divided opinion with regard to
Mrs. Morland, but the discords feared by Jim were not
heard at Rowdon Cottage. The chief reason for the
comparative harmony which reigned between kitchen
and sitting-room was the undisguised satisfaction of
Mrs. Macbean in being again in contact with gentle-people,
and in seeing her young master recognized as
one of them. It is to be feared that her estimation of
“gentlefolk” was strictly conventional, and that in her
heart of hearts she thought all the more of her “fine
leddy” mistress because Mrs. Morland never dreamed
of soiling her fingers over household matters, but
maintained a dignified privacy among the remnants
of her former prosperity.</p>

<p>Elizabeth found that a late dinner was expected
as a matter of course. Here, there might have
been a difficulty, since the old woman had been
in the habit of going home to her “gudeman” as
soon as she had served Jim’s tea and “tidied up”.
But while ordering dinner for half-past eight, Mrs.
Morland happened to mention that her stepson would
dine with her; and Elizabeth immediately became
complaisant.</p>

<p>Jim’s soul grew faint within him when he was
informed of the coming ordeal&mdash;a dinner <i>à deux</i> with
his stepmother. A refusal was on the poor lad’s lips,
but he held it back. He could do nothing, he supposed,
to narrow the gulf between himself and his father’s
second wife; but he had determined that no act or
word of his should make the gulf wider. He assented
quietly to Mrs. Morland’s peremptory demand for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
company in the sitting-room at half-past eight, and
promised meekly enough to don his Sunday suit before
he ventured to present himself.</p>

<p>He imagined that his stepmother’s request was
prompted solely by a desire to “teach him manners”,
and so render him a little more presentable to her
friends; but in this he did Mrs. Morland less than
justice. She was slow to act in matters for any reason
displeasing to her; but having once taken a step in
any direction, she did not care to turn back. She
had been, in her own limited sense, in earnest
when she had said that she would henceforth regard
Jim as the head of the family. She meant him to
endure to the full the penalties attaching at present
to the unenviable position, and would not strain a
nerve to lighten his load; but she intended also to see
that a certain respect and consideration should be
offered him by everyone except herself, and it was a
part of her plan that he should be found in her company
on fitting occasions.</p>

<p>The family meals were served in the children’s
study, but at none of these was the mother present.
Her breakfast was carried up to her bedroom, and she
lunched alone in her sitting-room. It was Austin’s
duty to take her cup backward and forward across
the passage at the children’s tea-hour. After dinner
Frances and Austin were ordered to appear for
dessert. Thus Mrs. Morland attempted to retain
among her present surroundings some of the customs
and restrictions of the life she had been used
to; though the imitation might be a faint likeness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
the model, and the result pathetic rather than impressive.</p>

<p>The various courses of the meal were perhaps only
Scotch broth, broiled chicken, and rice-pudding, and
the dessert a dish of apples and another of nuts.
But the glass, china, and silver were the joy of
Elizabeth’s soul; and the simple food must be served
most daintily. Jim was right in anticipating severe
drilling and remorseless fault-finding; yet, taking all
in wise humility, he had sense to acknowledge that
the experience had its value. He soon learned to
satisfy Mrs. Morland’s requirements as to his comportment
at table, and his association with her and
her children taught him quickly to note the errors in
his speech and to correct them for himself.</p>

<p>“The lad is no dullard,” admitted the victorious
stepmother in her thoughts; “he will be a gentleman
before he knows it. A gentleman-blacksmith! Delightful
absurdity! Oh, shall we never escape from
this dreadful place!”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<small>“MISSY.”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>After Christmas the winter arrived in earnest&mdash;such
a winter as England seldom sees. Day after
day keen “black” frost and bitter east wind brought
hard suffering to the poor. Jim banished Austin from
the smithy, and more than once the boy and his sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
were prevented from paying their visits to Woodbank,
and were reduced to “hearing each other” say their
well-prepared lessons. Florry was not seen at Rowdon
for a week at a time. Max came, of course; but
Max in greatcoat, comforter, and gaiters could defy
the weather.</p>

<p>Not so Austin; yet Austin, rash as ever, would
not stay indoors. Thus Jim got into disgrace; he
was condemned utterly as an aider and abettor of his
brother’s defiance of prudence. Jim it was who sharpened
and cleaned and polished Austin’s old skates,
by way of helping the younger lad to forget that
he was to have had a new pair that year. Jim it
was who announced that Rowdon Pond was bearing.
Jim it was who, having reasonable fears of the results
when Austin mooned listlessly about the lanes, suggested
the brisk exercise of skating as an excellent
way of keeping boyish blood in circulation.</p>

<p>Frances always declared that it was running out
without cap or overcoat, and standing in draughts,
and lingering for last words with Max at the gate,
which did it. But Mrs. Morland blamed Jim and the
pond; and Jim went for a fortnight with heavy
pain at his heart and fresh anxiety on his mind. For
he accepted Mrs. Morland’s view: and Austin was
very ill. Austin had not had so bad a throat for a
long time. He suffered much, poor boy; and Jim,
looking at him, suffered more. Dr. Brenton came
daily, and Doctor Max spent hours by the bedside.</p>

<p>Jim was night-nurse, at his own humble, imploring
request. In vain did Frances remind her mother that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
the “head of the house” went to his post after a long
day’s work. Mrs. Morland’s face was stony as she
declined to accept any excuses for the culprit. Jim
was the person at fault, and it was obviously just that
he should suffer for his sin. Jim thankfully bore this
sort of punishment, and tended Austin through the
night hours,&mdash;when pain and weakness made the
boy restless and irritable,&mdash;with infinite tenderness
and patience. Francis begged to be allowed to share
the watch, but Mrs. Morland was inexorable. She
required her daughter’s help in the sick-room during
the day, and Frances must take her usual rest or she
certainly would break down.</p>

<p>Frances thought “breaking down” more likely to
be Jim’s lot, as she watched her elder brother’s face,
with its haggard eyes, heavy from ceaseless fatigue,
and noted how worry and care were setting on his
brow their ineffaceable lines. Indeed, the extra burden
of Austin’s illness was leaving marks of its weight,
and Jim’s slight figure bowed beneath it.</p>

<p>But the trial was over presently. Austin was
better, he became convalescent; he must be carried
downstairs in Jim’s own arms, and be coddled and
spoiled in the warmest corner of the study. Jim
thought no self-denial too hard, no service too exacting;
and Austin would hardly have been mortal boy
had he never taken advantage of his willing slave.</p>

<p>When fear and trouble on Austin’s personal behalf
were ended, a dreadful sequel began. Bedroom fires
night and day made inroads into the coal-supply, and
invalid luxuries ran up expensive bills. Mrs. Morland’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
demands had not been unreasonable with regard to
her own table; but when Austin’s nourishment was
in question she ordered lavishly, hardly requiring
Jim’s entreaty that she would see that her boy lacked
nothing. During convalescence the lad’s appetite was
tempted with difficulty, and Jim’s only fear was lest
the port-wine should not be strong or plentiful
enough. Afterwards, however, the wine must be paid
for.</p>

<p>Jim took to sitting up late in his corner under the
roof,&mdash;how late nobody guessed; for Austin, in his
well-warmed bedroom, was always fast asleep when
his brother stole in. But the hard winter told on
trade, and Jim knew nothing of the best markets for
his wood-carving. He was glad to sell his dainty
work for a trifle to a little hook-nosed Jew who kept
a small “curiosity-shop” in Exham.</p>

<p>Jim reminded himself that he was now a man, and
that a man worth his salt ought to be able to maintain
his family&mdash;especially his “lady-folk”&mdash;in comfort.
He could not bring himself to suggest further “stinting”
to Elizabeth. The lad seemed possessed with a
feverish activity. He went to the farmers round
about, and found all sorts of odd pieces of work with
which to fill up every minute not required by his
special trade. Anything to earn a few shillings, and
to delay that borrowing from capital and lessening of
interest which must surely some day bring ruin on
the little home where he sheltered his cherished
kindred.</p>

<p>Jim hid his troubles with desperate courage, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
there was somebody who was not entirely deceived.
Frances had not forgotten that first interview between
Jim and his stepmother on the latter’s coming to
Rowdon, and her clear sense had taught her to suspect
that the finances of the cottage were giving her
elder brother some reason for his harassed look. The
girl longed to ease his burden, but she did not know
how to invite his confidence. The constraint between
them had not lessened sufficiently to allow Frances
the opportunity of penetrating his carefully-concealed
secret.</p>

<p>At last chance played poor Jim a trick, and he
stood revealed.</p>

<p>“Austin,” said Frances one evening, looking up from
her books, “do you know where Jim is? It’s so
frightfully cold to-night&mdash;surely he can’t be in the
smithy still?”</p>

<p>“I hope not. I wish I could go to see.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t, indeed. The wind cuts like a lash,
and the place where Jim works is right open to it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s hard lines for a fellow to be mewed up
here. Frances, it’s Saturday. Jim is always late on
Saturdays.”</p>

<p>“He’s late every night now, I think. He just gives
himself time to dress for dinner; and after dinner he
spends half an hour studying with us, then he
vanishes upstairs. And he hardly eats anything; he’s
getting quite thin.” There was a hint of tears in
the girl’s voice, though she did not add aloud her
conviction&mdash;“I believe he goes without, to leave more
for us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>“We must look after him better,” said Austin
uneasily. “He’s such a right-down good chap, he
never thinks of himself.”</p>

<p>“No, never. I’ll go and look after him now, Austin.
I’ll make him come to the warm room.”</p>

<p>Frances wrapped herself in a woollen shawl, borrowed
Austin’s “Tam-o’-Shanter”, and went out softly
at the front door. Down the side-path, over a thick
carpet of snow, she crept stealthily into view of the
smithy. The fires were out: clearly Jim had left his
forge. She kept the pathway, and skirted the larger
building to reach the closed-in shed behind it, where
stood the carpenter’s bench. Here Jim often worked
after regular hours, and here she found him to-night.</p>

<p>The girl peeped in through the small window, and
at once saw her brother, seated on a rough stool by a
rough trestle-table. A few books and papers were
spread before him, but he was not examining them,
though Frances could see that they were account-books
and bills. Jim’s arms rested on the table, his hands
supported his upturned face, which, in the light of
his little lamp, looked rigid in its blank misery.</p>

<p>For a moment Frances was startled; then the sight
of the papers, and the recollection of many things,
brought home to her the truth of her recent suspicions.
Now, if ever, was the time to speak. If Jim were
vexed by her interference, he still might be persuaded
to explain his position; and then surely it would be
her right to try to help him.</p>

<p>Frances opened the shed door softly, and closed it
behind her when she had passed in. The place was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
bitterly cold. Jim’s face looked pinched and wan as
he turned and gazed at her in dumb surprise. His
hands, moving mechanically, swept the bills together
with an instinctive effort to hide them; but Frances,
walking straight to his side, pointed deliberately to
the little heap of crushed papers.</p>

<p>“Jim, I’ve caught you at last!”</p>

<p>“Missy!” ejaculated Jim, and gazing still at the
determined intruder he stumbled on to his feet.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve caught you, so you needn’t attempt to
get off telling the truth!” The girl feared that the
laboured jocularity of her tone wasn’t much of a
success, and continued with a natural quiver in her
voice: “Oh, Jim, you mustn’t think I’m quite blind, or
that I don’t care. I’ve seen for a long time back how
worried you have been, and I’ve guessed that something
must have gone wrong.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Missy,” said Jim, in a low voice. “I
suppose I’m a coward, or I shouldn’t show so plainly
when I’ve a little difficulty to meet. But I didn’t
know that anyone&mdash;that you would notice.” The lad’s
eyes grew very soft. “You must please forgive me,
Missy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jim,” exclaimed Frances, perplexed by this
disarming entreaty, “I wish you wouldn’t talk like
that! Do&mdash;do tell me what’s wrong!”</p>

<p>“It’s not anything for you to know, Missy. Indeed,
it’s just my own affair&mdash;I’d not trouble you with it.
Don’t mind me if I seem a bit downhearted now and
again. I’m just a rough fellow, and forget my duty
sometimes, like as not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>“No, Jim, you remember it far too well. You make
all the horrid things your duty, and won’t understand
that Austin and I want to go shares. And I will
know. So now, Jim, tell me.”</p>

<p>Frances persisted with argument and entreaty until
she had drawn her brother’s secret from his lips.
Having learned the facts, she set to work energetically
to propose a remedy.</p>

<p>“We must not spend so much, Jim,” she remarked,
knitting her brows seriously. She now occupied the
stool, Jim standing by her side with all the air of a
conscious defaulter. “It will never do to keep on
drawing from your capital. I understand about ‘capital
and interest’ quite well&mdash;really I do. I know that
if capital grows less, so will the interest. We don’t
want our interest less, so we mustn’t touch our capital.”
(Jim’s eyes brightened as he heard the plural possessive.)
“Now,” Frances went on, “listen to me, and
don’t interrupt, and don’t contradict. I sha’n’t allow
you to contradict! We can do without Elizabeth,
and we must.”</p>

<p>“Why, Missy&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Jim! I like Elizabeth ever so much; but
she costs a good deal, and we won’t keep her. She will
easily get another place; for I’ll tell Miss Carlyon about
her, and what an old dear she is.” Jim smiled forlornly
at the epithet applied to angular Mrs. Macbean.
“You see, it’s wicked to employ people you can’t
afford to pay; and I’m sure we can’t afford to pay
Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>Jim clenched his hands behind his back. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
were strong, capable hands; why, oh why, could he
not fill them with gold for Missy!</p>

<p>“We can do quite well without her,” persisted
Frances, her courage rising bravely to the emergency.
Jim watched the kindling of the girl’s intelligent face,
and wondered whether he had known before that
gentle-voiced Missy possessed so plucky a spirit.
“She&mdash;or someone else&mdash;might come, perhaps, once
a week: to wash, you know, Jim, and to clean the
kitchen. I shall do the rest.”</p>

<p>“You!” gasped Jim.</p>

<p>“Of course. I can cook and sweep and dust&mdash;yes,
and I’ll learn to scrub. Why not?”</p>

<p>“No, Missy. Oh, don’t put that shame on me!”
muttered Jim, in an agony of mental distress. “’Tis
no work for little ladies: and a man ought to bear the
burdens by himself. I’ll get more to do&mdash;indeed I
will! You sha’n’t need to worry, if only you’ll not say
Elizabeth must go.”</p>

<p>“But I do say it, Jim,” said Frances solemnly; “I
wish I could send you to Haversfield, and let Miss
Cliveden talk to you. She’d show you what a goose
you were to think ladies&mdash;no, gentlewomen&mdash;are disgraced
by work. Why, loads of splendid, clever
women earn their own living; and I’ve always thought
I’d love to earn mine. Look at Miss Carlyon&mdash;she
isn’t ashamed to work for herself, and not be a burden
to her brother.”</p>

<p>“But her work’s so different, Missy,” pleaded Jim.</p>

<p>“As if that mattered! Still, if you think it does,
and won’t let me help here, I’ll try another plan. I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
fifteen now, and I dare say I might teach little children.
Mrs. Stanley wants a nursery governess, Max says. I
shall beg her to take me.”</p>

<p>“Missy!” Jim’s tone was now one of the blankest,
most thorough dismay. “Go away from home&mdash;leave
Rowdon” murmured the lad incredulously. “Why,
’twould take all the light from the place. You’d never&mdash;Missy!&mdash;you’d
never do it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to, if you won’t be reasonable,” said
Frances severely. “Of course I’d rather stay here,
and teach just you, and look after Austin, and take
care of Mamma. But if you won’t let me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Missy,” said Jim nervously, “you know you’re
mistress at Rowdon. I won’t say&mdash;anything. But
oh, don’t go away!”</p>

<p>Frances discreetly followed up her advantage, and
made her brother promise to dismiss Elizabeth with
the usual notice. It was to be done in the kindest,
most appreciative way; and Mrs. Macbean was to be
asked if she would care to have another situation
found for her, or if she would take daily work, and
keep Saturdays for the cottage.</p>

<p>Then Jim was requested to put away the tiresome
bills, and go indoors and get his lessons ready at once.</p>

<p>It was his first experience of his sister as “mistress”.
Never before had she assumed the voice of the dictator,
never before had she ordered him about. Jim felt
that he liked it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now little Frances the Altruist was indeed a
woman of affairs. Jim kept his word, and after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
reluctant departure of Elizabeth attempted no remonstrance;
he tried faithfully to control his feelings
when he saw his sister cook and sweep and dust.
Only, if she rose early, he rose earlier; and she never
came down to find a fireless, uncared-for grate. Her
cans were filled with water, her scuttles with coal,
before her light step could be heard on the stairs.</p>

<p>After due thought, Frances had decided that Austin
should share Jim’s secret.</p>

<p>“It won’t do him any harm to know all Jim has
tried to do for us,” she reflected wisely; “and I think,
somehow, it will help him to be manly and brave
himself.”</p>

<p>So Austin was told, and received the news with
preternatural gravity.</p>

<p>“All right, Sis! Jim can keep his hair on; he
sha’n’t be ruined yet awhile, if we know it. Peace to
the shades of the departed Elizabeth! You’ll boss the
show, and I’ll be second in command.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland, also, received a communication from
Frances. Jim was forthwith sent for&mdash;being suspected
of having a weaker will than the one she had just
encountered,&mdash;and obliged to listen to keen upbraiding,
even to merciless taunts. Jim, pale and suffering, could
reply only that Mrs. Morland’s opinions were humbly
acknowledged as his own; and that if Missy could be
induced to abandon her scheme, he would thankfully
support motherly authority.</p>

<p>But Frances the Altruist took her own way.</p>

<p>The young people of Rowdon Cottage formed themselves
into a sort of household league, and speedily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
discovered the benefits of co-operation. Jim toiled
early and late; but his trouble shared was trouble
lightened by at least one appreciable fact&mdash;the absence
of need for further concealment. His distress of mind
at the sight of his fellow-toilers grew no less, in spite
of arguments drawn unconsciously from the propaganda
of enlightened social economists; but his love
for those two children who thus bravely tried to help
him grew greater, and taught him more, day by day.</p>

<p>Frances had found her contentment, and was “happy
again”. Her loyal friend Florry might now have
roamed the Continent, if this desired consummation
had indeed sufficed to send her there. But happy,
busy Frances was more than ever a companion to be
sought by a girl who never had been otherwise than
happy and busy. Florry “begged lifts” from Dr.
Brenton oftener than ever, and enjoyed her part in
the cookery and housework quite as much as she
enjoyed the talks about books and the comparisons of
lessons which came in between, when folks wanted a
rest.</p>

<p>Austin was positively refused regular employment
as maid-of-all-work, so he kept on the look-out and
seized his chances. At night he would prowl about
in search of the family boots, and would hide them in
a secret nook, so that in the morning he might try his
hand at a new and original system of “blacking”.
He would creep through the house, gather up the
mats in a swoop, and depart, chuckling, to do mighty
execution in the back-yard. Max, if on the spot, of
course assisted like a man and a brother. Frances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
only had to hint that any special cleansing process
was under consideration, and three young Altruists
got ready for the fray.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Hi, old man! How’s that for a carpet?”</p>

<p>Jim, anxious-eyed but smiling, professed profound
admiration, and disappeared within his shed.</p>

<p>It was an April afternoon. Max and Austin, armed
with flat sticks, stood on either side of a well-stretched
rope, whereon hung the study carpet. The Altruists
were spring-cleaning, and Rowdon Cottage resounded
with their songs of triumph. Jim had timidly suggested
Elizabeth as a helper, but the idea had been
rejected with scorn.</p>

<p>Kind Mrs. Fane had taken a hint from Florry, and
had carried off Mrs. Morland to spend a week with
her&mdash;“while the children amused themselves turning
everything upside down”. Florry went to Rowdon to
keep Frances company, by way of exchange of guests;
and other Altruists dropped in promiscuously to “lend
a hand”. It was the Easter holidays, so persons of
leisure were free to make themselves useful.</p>

<p>Max and Austin stood wiping their fevered brows
and admiring their work. They were on the drying-green,
which widened out into an orchard that was
the pride of Rowdon Cottage. Presently to the green
entered a little procession.</p>

<p>Firstly, Guy Gordon, bearing a pile of footstools,
and thumping the top one energetically as he marched
to a whistled war-song. Next, Florry, carrying
cushions many and various. Then, Frances, with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
armful of curtains. Next, the small and rosy-cheeked
boy&mdash;brother to Guy&mdash;who long ago had inquired of
Frances, “What is an Altruist?” Bertie bore nothing
except himself, and found the task sufficient, for indeed
he was plumper than Betty Turner. Last of all
came Betty herself, with a basket of stockings and
socks. Betty had volunteered to bring the cottage
darning and mending up to date as her contribution
to the proceedings. One can sit very comfortably on
a bank under a tree while one darns the family hose.</p>

<p>Then arose a very Babel. The various persons of
the procession betook themselves to convenient spots
in the orchard, and set about their business. Guy
deposited his footstools on the grass, and thrusting a
stick into the hand of small Bertie, left him with the
laconic order:</p>

<p>“See there isn’t a grain of dust in them when I get
back!”</p>

<p>Then off flew Guy to the carpet-beating, which was
more inspiriting than footstools. The flat sticks started
afresh to the tune of “Three Jolly Sailor Boys”, roared
in lusty trebles. Frances, with Florry’s aid, shook
her curtains, Betty seated herself picturesquely out
of reach of the dust, Bertie banged away to his heart’s
content, and the orchard echoed the drying-green in
a rousing chorus. Round about, the fruit-trees, in all
their loveliness of pink and white, averted the dazzling
April sunshine. Betty, among the violets and primroses,
examined heels and toes with critical attention,
while her voice joined involuntarily in the “Sailor
Boys”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t it jolly?” demanded Max, during a pause for
breath. “Here’s an Altruist entertainment given
gratis and for nothing to the ducks and chickens!
Now, then, girls, it’s your turn to lead off. Let’s have
something sweet!”</p>

<p>Frances started Mendelssohn’s “Farewell to the
Forest”, and Miss Carlyon’s “Selected Choir” gave
three parts in melodious first and second treble and
alto. Jim brought his work to the door of his shed
and listened happily. The sound of the young voices,
ringing through the clear spring air, came to his ears
as a reminder of his changed conditions, which had in
them much of trouble, yet more of joy.</p>

<p>Back and forward between cottage and orchard
went the merry troop through the long afternoon.
A very respectable amount of work had been got
through when, at half-past five, Frances called a halt
for tea.</p>

<p>By common consent the pleasant meal was taken
out of doors, under the apple-boughs. The girls went
into the house, cut bread-and-butter, and piled plates
with scones and cakes, while the boys spread the cloth
and fetched and carried. All the visiting Altruists
had brought contributions to the feast, but Elizabeth’s
scones, left at the door with Mrs. Macbean’s respectful
duty, were in chief demand.</p>

<p>“Good old Elizabeth!” chuckled Austin. “She’s a
first-rater. She bakes scones once a week, and never
forgets ‘Mr. Jim’. I say, Mr. Jim, here’s a second
supply, well-buttered. Finished? What rot! Pull
him down, Max, and send up his cup!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>“I made this cake myself, Jim,” whispered Florry.
“It’s ever so sweet&mdash;and all boys like sweet things.”</p>

<p>Jim, always grateful for Florry’s simple friendliness,
found he could eat the cake nicely. He was next
supplied with an egg, which Guy’s hen had been
obliging enough to lay, and Betty to boil, on purpose
for him. Frances would be hurt if he did not do
justice to her home-made brown bread. Altogether,
the youngsters took care that Jim’s tea was a hearty
one. The lad had dropped, some time ago, the idea
that these girls and boys might despise the blacksmith-brother.
He knew, without any sentimental demonstrativeness
on their part, that they all accounted
him “a brick”, and he tried earnestly to deserve the
flattering compliment. He did not know how industriously
Frances and Austin sang his praises, and
with what honest pride they spoke of the hard and
self-denying toil which set so high an example that
they could not but be up and struggling to follow it.</p>

<p>Tea over, work began again, and lasted till the
shadows lengthening “from each westward thing”
brought the Altruists’ busy day to a close. The
visitors straggled homeward, with Frances, Florry,
and Austin travelling as far as the Common to speed
them on their way. They were very tired, and very
jolly, and very well pleased with themselves. Who
could say that spring-cleaning had not its aspects
picturesque and poetic? Who could deny these virtuous
labourers the right to rouse the echoes with
a song of parting, and with yet another to the next
good meeting?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>Austin ran all the way home that he might coax
Jim out for a peaceful stroll. Frances and Florry,
left together, exchanged confidences and opinions after
their manner. At length, among desultory talk, Florry
suddenly opened a brisk campaign.</p>

<p>“Frances, do you remember saying, when you first
went to Rowdon, that you couldn’t come back to our
Society&mdash;your Society&mdash;till you were gooder?”</p>

<p>Frances assented doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re just as much gooder as any mortal
girl wants to be.”</p>

<p>Frances kept expressive silence.</p>

<p>“If you were any gooder than you are now, I should
be certain you were falling into a decline. Anyway,
you’re an Altruist of Altruists, if our motto counts for
anything, for I’m sure you ‘help others’ all day long.
We’ve a meeting to-morrow evening. I am going over
to it, and I mean to take you with me, and Austin
too. It’s a mixed meeting&mdash;girls and boys; and afterwards
we’ve a choir practice.”</p>

<p>Frances’s eyes kindled as she heard of these remembered
joys. She was by no means unhealthily self-introspective
by nature; and since she had repented
her unworthy treatment of Jim, and done her best to
make amends, the load of sensitive shame and humiliation
had seemed to fall from her heart. Need she
longer hold aloof from the comrades to whom she had
once ventured to speak&mdash;parrot-like, as it now appeared
to her awakened sense, and ignorant of real issues&mdash;such
brave words of fellowship and admiration towards
all those who did worthily the world’s exacting work?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
Might she not again take her place among them, better
instructed and less ready to instruct?</p>

<p>Florry found that persuasion was not needed.
Frances was too sincere to profess a belief in difficulties
which time had swept away. She replied,
very truthfully and willingly, that she longed to refill
the Altruist work-basket.</p>

<p>“I could give odd half-hours to it, you know, Florry.
The mornings are so light now, I could easily rise a
little earlier.”</p>

<p>“Mamma says it is always the busy people who do
the most. Oh, dear Frances, I am so glad! You will
see, to-morrow, how badly you have been missed.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<small>MRS. MORLAND’S TRIO.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Morland, in a sober evening dress of black
silk, inhabited her sitting-room in solitary state.
The nest her children’s love had prepared for her was
fresh and sweet as an Altruist spring-cleaning could
make it; and its occupant, surrounded by pretty and
dainty things, looked in no want of pity as she sat by
her cosy fireside, a volume of Tennyson in her hands.
Yet on this particular evening the leisurely reader
seemed not entirely at ease. Her eyes wandered continually
from her book, and the expression of her
face had for once lost its satisfaction with self and
impatience with the rest of the world. In thought as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
in act Mrs. Morland was slow to admit novelty; but
a simple occurrence of the afternoon had touched her
imagination, and inclined her to observe intelligently
various matters which helped to make the small sum
of her daily experience.</p>

<p>A little earlier she had been entertaining visitors&mdash;only
Muriel and Edward Carlyon. But those young
people possessed alert and vigorous individualities
which were apt to leave a track where they had been.
They talked well on a good many subjects, and had
the pleasant knack of choosing those subjects with due
regard to their company. Mrs. Morland liked them
both, and was by no means insensible to the kindness
which had made Frances and Austin their pupils
still. So she had listened graciously, and spoken a few
appropriate words of thanks when the brother and
sister had warmly commended her children’s progress.</p>

<p>“How proud you must be of them!” Miss Carlyon
had exclaimed, determined to do her favourites justice.
“Do you know, I think no one ever had a brighter trio
than yours.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland stiffened perceptibly as she heard the
word “trio”.</p>

<p>“My two children always have given me every satisfaction,”
she replied with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Never more than now, I am sure,” said Muriel
gently.</p>

<p>“Jim is a first-rate fellow,” remarked Edward.
“Boyish for his years, perhaps, and overpoweringly
conscientious. But I believe, when he goes out into
the world, he will make his mark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“He is a worthy, unassuming lad,” said Mrs. Morland
indifferently. “I should hardly have credited him
with more than an average share of brains. Of course,
I readily admit that he has had no advantages.”</p>

<p>Edward gaily contested the point, arguing that in
learning to use his hands as well as his head, Jim had
provided himself with two forces instead of one to aid
him in doing battle with difficulties. Mrs. Morland
declined to show interest in Jim, but she listened
courteously to her stepson’s praises, and left her combatant
in possession of the field.</p>

<p>The two visitors were disarmed, and began to think
they might hitherto have done their hostess injustice
on some points at least. They had walked out of set
purpose to Rowdon that afternoon, after stirring up
each other, as their habit was, to undertake a doubtful
errand. They were wondering now whether they might
not hope&mdash;with the mother in this gracious mood&mdash;to
make that errand something of a success.</p>

<p>“And how is Frances, our own dear Altruist?” questioned
Muriel presently. “I thought yesterday that
she was looking pale and tired.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! I have not heard her complain. She has
excellent health, fortunately, and is altogether stronger
than Austin.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Austin will make a sturdy fellow by and by,”
said Carlyon cheerily.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile,” said Muriel tentatively, “I hope our
pair of pickles aren’t overdoing it? You will forgive
me, Mrs. Morland, I’m sure, if I intrude on you with
selfish anxieties. You see, Edward and I can’t contemplate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
with equanimity the loss of our pupils, and
Frances has been telling me that she is afraid she
must give up some of her studies.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland flushed angrily. “She has said nothing
of the kind to me.”</p>

<p>“She would not wish to worry you,” added Muriel
in haste; “and she did not speak definitely&mdash;only, I
understood it was a question between home duties and
school lessons. As Frances has passed the Oxford
Junior Locals, I wanted her to get ready for the
Senior; but if she has not time for the necessary
preparation, there is no more to be said.”</p>

<p>“I had a scholarship in view for Austin,” said
Carlyon, before Mrs. Morland could speak. The brother
and sister felt themselves on thorny ground, and feared
a retreat might be forced on them. “It would help to
take him to the University. Still, he is right to stick
to his sister.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t let our foolish ambitions vex you,
dear Mrs. Morland,” said Muriel, rising to lay her
hand with a pretty gesture on the elder woman’s arm.
“If our young people choose the better part, we can
only love them all the more, and be all the more proud
of them. They will learn a great deal in helping Jim.
Do you know, I am quite jealous of Frances’s success
as a rival teacher? Now, Edward, you and I must
run away. We are due at the rectory at six o’clock.”</p>

<p>The visitors said good-bye to a very stately, monosyllabic
hostess, whose geniality had vanished, and
left moroseness behind. At first Mrs. Morland was
strongly moved to summon Frances for a severe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
lecture, but she felt herself handicapped by her
ignorance as to the truth. She had no real knowledge
of the manner in which her children spent their days;
and had objected to the work they had undertaken, in
Elizabeth’s place, on account of its nature, not because
she realized its amount. But if it were indeed the
case that sweeping and scrubbing had absorbed the
hours due to Latin and mathematics, in what direction
could she exercise her authority? Somebody must
sweep and scrub, if the spotlessness on which Mrs.
Morland tacitly insisted were to be maintained at
Rowdon Cottage.</p>

<p>For a time, indignation with her “trio” and their
too officious friends occupied Mrs. Morland’s thoughts
entirely; but compunctions were stirring her memory,
and she began to recall more exactly, and to examine
more thoroughly, the few remarks her late visitors
had made. She wondered whether she had indeed left
it to an outsider to notice that Frances looked “pale
and tired”, and why her girl and boy should not have
come first of all to their mother with their doubts as
to their ability to keep up their lessons. Mrs. Morland
had seen plainly that the Carlyons had spoken with
some trepidation and fear of giving offence. She felt
obliged to admit that they had not willingly broken
the laws of good taste, but had made an honest effort
to serve their young friends by letting fall such hints
as might induce the children’s mother to give more
attention to their affairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland’s thoughts were still dwelling on these
matters, when the door opened softly and Frances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
entered, carrying a snowy table-cloth of finest damask,
such as it was Elizabeth’s pride to handle. Next came
Austin, with a folding-stand and butler’s tray, which
he set up close to the door. Mrs. Morland was seated
so that she could face her children, and she watched
them furtively from the cover of her fan. The young
pair were so unaccustomed to attract their mother’s
notice while about their daily duties that they behaved
as though she were as deep in Tennyson as they supposed
her to be.</p>

<p>Frances deftly spread the cloth, while Austin fussed
gravely over his tray. Presently they began to lay
the covers for two, and to deck the table with pretty
crystal and silver. There were no “specimen” vases,
but they had a big bowl filled with white narcissus
and ivy for a centre-piece.</p>

<p>“Is Jim ready?” questioned Frances in a low voice.
“I have no soup to-day, but Mr. Carlyon brought a
lovely pair of soles, and I have fried them most beautifully.
Mamma likes fried soles. Jim is so thoughtful,
he is sure to remember to say he won’t have any; then
there will be one left for Mamma’s breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Austin laconically. “Isn’t there anything
for Jim?”</p>

<p>“Silly! Of course there is! I made rissoles out of
that cold beef.”</p>

<p>Austin sighed.</p>

<p>“I have kept one back for you, dear,” said Frances
quickly. “I know you hate cold beef. You shall eat
that delicious rissole while I dish the pudding.”</p>

<p>The two now wrangled in undertones as to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
should enjoy the comparative dainty of a rissole, and
Mrs. Morland laughed behind her fan until she feared
detection. Finally, Austin decided that the morsel
should be halved, and the preparations then proceeded
in uninterrupted solemnity.</p>

<p>“Is Jim ready?” inquired Frances again. “My soles
will be spoilt if dinner is kept waiting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jim’s all right. He’s turning out the potatoes.”</p>

<p>“Austin! Last time Jim meddled with the potatoes
he let one drop into the ashes&mdash;and he nearly spoiled
his best coat!”</p>

<p>“Well, if he’s such a duffer he must go without,
himself.”</p>

<p>“I shall fly to the rescue. Oh, Austin, you promised
to mix the fresh mustard!”</p>

<p>“Crikey! So I did! I’ll do it now, in half a
jiffey.”</p>

<p>“Come then; it’s half-past eight already!”</p>

<p>Frances retired in haste to the kitchen, packed Jim
off to the sitting-room, and served up her three courses
in fine style. Mrs. Morland, intent on observations,
dined almost in silence; and Jim, amazed to find
neither his mind nor his manners undergoing improvement,
wondered nervously of what heinous offence he
had been guilty unawares. Austin brought in the
dishes, and waited at table with the utmost confidence
and resource. It was his little joke to call himself
Adolphus the page-boy, in which character he indulged
in various small witticisms, chiefly, it must be owned,
for the benefit of Frances. When he had placed a
scanty dessert before his mother, he went off, to reappear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
immediately in Frances’s wake in his own
character of Master Austin Morland.</p>

<p>He wore an evening suit of black velvet, which,
having been made eighteen months before, was an
exceedingly tight fit for its owner. Mrs. Morland
now became aware of the fact, and felt a sudden
qualm as she anticipated the time when the children’s
stock of good, well-made clothing would be finally
worn out or outgrown. She determined to put off,
for that evening at least, her intended demand for the
immediate re-engagement of Elizabeth, and the release
of Frances from “household drudgery”. She would
hardly have acknowledged that a part of that forbearing
resolution was due to the awakened eyes
with which she now regarded the third of her “trio”.
Jim’s face was pale and tired beyond all possibility
of concealment.</p>

<p>The meal was ended. Mrs. Morland returned to her
Tennyson, and the trio returned to their various tasks.
For more than an hour the solitary woman sat on by
her fireside deep in thought. Glancing up, at length,
she saw that her clock pointed to a quarter-past ten,
and it occurred to her that the children had not yet
come to bid her good-night. Rising with a little shiver,
for the room was growing chilly, she crossed the
passage to the study, and, opening the door gently,
peered in. The three students were gathered together,
to share the light of the single small lamp. Frances
was correcting an exercise for Jim, who listened intently
while she lucidly explained his mistakes. Austin
struggled with Greek verbs, repeating them under his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
breath, while he held his hands to his ears, and rocked
his body to and fro, after the familiar fashion of
industrious schoolboys.</p>

<p>Consternation took the place of contentment when
Mrs. Morland made the young folks aware of her
presence by inquiring whether they knew the hour.</p>

<p>“It is a quarter-past ten,” she remarked, her voice
falling on a guilty silence. “You know, Frances and
Austin, I do not like you to be up later than ten.”</p>

<p>“We have nearly finished, Mamma. We go to Woodbank
to-morrow, and we shall not have our lessons
ready unless we do them to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why not, pray? Are there no morning hours
before you? And what is this I hear from Miss
Carlyon, Frances? Have you really taken it upon
yourself to tell her, without first consulting me, that
you are prepared to dispense with her kind help?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamma,” exclaimed Frances, “Miss Carlyon
could not have thought&mdash;. Indeed, I didn’t say it that
way!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said Mrs. Morland, half-ashamed of
her injustice; “but you said it in some way, and I am
very much annoyed. A child like you has no business
to decide for herself whether she will or will not
accept so great a favour.”</p>

<p>“I only didn’t want to worry you, Mamma; and I
didn’t think&mdash;I didn’t guess you would mind about
my lessons.”</p>

<p>“I dare say your intentions were good, Frances,” said
Mrs. Morland less sharply; “but you certainly should
have come to me first. You cannot really have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
so foolish as to suppose that I am indifferent about
your studies. They may be of the utmost importance
to you some day.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Frances eagerly. “So, won’t you let
me sit up a little later sometimes?”</p>

<p>“I can’t do that, for the best of reasons. You rise&mdash;as
I know to my cost&mdash;very early; and I must
insist on your taking proper rest. But I see no
obstacle to your finding plenty of opportunity for
study in the daytime. What is it that comes in the
way?”</p>

<p>Frances glanced up at Jim, and meeting his troubled
look answered pleadingly:</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all about it when you come upstairs
to-night, Mamma dear. Won’t that do?”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Mrs. Morland, feeling a new
and strange reluctance to prolong the discomfort she
had brought to the industrious little group. Memory
again spoke in her ears with Miss Carlyon’s voice the
familiar words about choosing the better part. She
went back to her room, stirred the smouldering fire,
and sank into her luxurious chair. Something&mdash;could
it be conscience?&mdash;was stirring fiercely within her;
and qualities long dormant rose up and cried her
shame.</p>

<p>She had been alone but a few minutes when Jim
came into the room. The lad, still white and weary-eyed,
moved with his quiet, undisturbing step to Mrs.
Morland’s side.</p>

<p>“I wanted to tell you something,” he began diffidently;
“something perhaps you don’t know. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
that, for a good while back, the children have been
helping me&mdash;teaching me, I mean, besides learning
their own lessons. I wanted so much to learn, that
I’m afraid I forgot how I was taking up their time;
but indeed I never guessed that Missy was going to
leave off any of her lessons with Miss Carlyon. Of
course I will manage so that she need not. I hope
you won’t worry, or be vexed with Missy. It’s all my
fault.”</p>

<p>“And how do you propose to ‘manage’, as you say?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland’s keen gaze fell steadily on her stepson’s
face.</p>

<p>“I will not let Missy be troubled with me,” said Jim.
“That will make some difference.”</p>

<p>“But you want to learn?”</p>

<p>“Ay. I will learn, too, somehow, but not at the
children’s cost. I can do a smith’s work without
Latin; but my brother and sister are to be something
different.”</p>

<p>“You are resolved on that?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“And if they do not teach you, they will have time
for their own studies?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell that; but I can easily get up an hour
earlier and help more in the house.”</p>

<p>“When do you rise now, James?”</p>

<p>“Not till five,” replied Jim eagerly. “It would be
nothing to rise at four.”</p>

<p>“But if my ears haven’t deceived me, I’ve heard
stealthy steps going to your bedroom at one, and even
two, in the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>Jim stood detected and confused.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Morland calmly, “I’ll think over
matters and let you know if I agree to your ingenious
plan. Meanwhile, James, I would rather you went to
bed a little earlier and rose a little later. And I
object to your giving up your lessons with the children.
I have no doubt that in helping you they help themselves;
but in any case I wish you to go on remembering
that if you are a blacksmith you are also a
gentleman.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland enjoyed the knowledge that her stepson
was utterly astonished and subdued; and she
went on in the same level tone:</p>

<p>“I never was more convinced of the latter fact than
I am this evening. Now, good-night, James! Go to
bed, and get rid of that headache.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the whole of the following couple of days
Mrs. Morland displayed an unwonted activity, though
in a direction her children found terribly discomfiting.
On this or that pretext she contrived to maintain a
careful watch on everybody’s movements, and some
of the youngsters’ most cherished and harmless secrets
were dragged to light. Thus, Frances was surprised
by her mother in the act of “washing out” certain
dainty frills which it always had been supposed were
left to Mrs. Macbean’s tender mercies. Austin was
discovered peeling potatoes in the study, whither he
had been banished for fear of draughts, while Jim
cleaned the kitchen windows. And Jim’s feelings may
be imagined when his workshop was invaded by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
stately presence of his stepmother, who had donned a
shawl and wandered through the darkness merely to
inquire if he happened to know whether a quarter to
ten were the correct time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland’s inspection was thorough enough to
supply her with a basis of facts whereon to build
further meditations and resolutions. Perhaps the
latter were confirmed by a conversation she overheard
through a door left ajar accidentally:</p>

<p>“I say, Frances, isn’t the Mater getting awfully spry?
She has been going about no end the last two days.”</p>

<p>“Yes. She seems ever so much better and stronger,
doesn’t she? Wouldn’t it be jolly if she would come
for a walk with us sometimes, and go visiting a little,
as she used to? She wouldn’t always be so dull if she
had more change.”</p>

<p>“She came and watched me feed my chickens this
morning. Fancy! she said she had no idea I had gone
in for poultry rearing! I believe I must have forgotten
to tell her about it. I showed her my ducklings, too,
and promised her one for dinner soon.”</p>

<p>“Mamma asked me where I had learned to make
such nice puddings. Wasn’t it dear of her to notice?
I shall turn out lovely pancakes to-night&mdash;she likes
pancakes.”</p>

<p>“Anybody would like your pancakes. May I have
the little burnt one at the end?”</p>

<p>“You unkind boy, it isn’t always burnt! Perhaps
I’ll give you a whole proper one for a treat, as you
provide the eggs.”</p>

<p>On the third day after the Carlyons’ visit, Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
Morland once more surprised the little housewife and
her male servitors. They were at breakfast in the
kitchen; for Frances, to save coal, had decreed that the
study fire should not be lighted in the early morning.</p>

<p>“Is this an innovation, young people?” demanded
the newcomer amiably. “Thank you, James; I will
take Austin’s chair, and he can fetch another. Really”&mdash;and
Mrs. Morland glanced critically round the bright,
clean kitchen&mdash;“you look remarkably comfortable here.
Your copper pans do you credit, Frances.”</p>

<p>“Jim scoured the pans, Mamma dear,” said the girl,
recovering from the shock of discovery. “And I do
think they’re pretty. Mayn’t I give you some tea?
Oh no! not this, of course&mdash;I’ll make some fresh.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I’m sure you can spare me a cup of
yours. That tea-pot has immense capacity, and if
these lads haven’t drained it&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s lots,” said Austin, lifting the lid of
the big brown pot. “Only, you see, Mater, it’s&mdash;it’s a
little nurseryfied. Frances doesn’t approve of strong
tea for our youthful digestions. I’ve plenty of boiling
water in my kettle, and you shall have a special
brew.”</p>

<p>Jim had risen quietly and placed a small clothes-horse,
over which he had thrown a cloth, between
Mrs. Morland and the fire. Meanwhile his stepmother,
with a swift glance that escaped detection, had surveyed
the young people’s fare. A home-baked loaf, a
plate of scones, butter, and marmalade. For Austin
alone, a boiled egg. All set out with exquisite cleanliness,
and appetizing enough in itself, but hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
sufficient preparation for a long and hard day’s
work.</p>

<p>“Frances has found some dainty for my breakfast-tray
each morning,” reflected Mrs. Morland, and at
that moment Frances spoke.</p>

<p>“Your kidneys are still in the larder, Mamma.
Would you like them cooked sooner than usual since
you are down so early?”</p>

<p>“They will do nicely for dinner,” said Mrs. Morland.
“I am going to breakfast with you, and cannot
possibly resist those scones any longer.”</p>

<p>The amazed silence of the group may not have been
entirely complimentary, but Mrs. Morland seemed unconcerned,
and forced speech on “James” by inquiring
whether he were responsible for the shining dish-covers
as well as the copper pans. The freshly-made
tea was praised generously; and altogether Mrs. Morland
showed a welcome disposition to admire everything.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the workers of the family prepared
to set about their usual duties. Jim went off to the
forge, Austin departed to feed his chickens, Frances
began to clear the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” said Mrs. Morland, while
she helped to gather together cups and plates, “that
for the future Jim and I will dine with you children
in the middle of the day.”</p>

<p>“Mamma!” exclaimed Frances, standing statue-like
in her amazement.</p>

<p>“It would be at least an hour’s saving of your time&mdash;oh!
more than that. However simple your cookery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
it must require a good deal of attention; then, there is
the serving, and after all the washing of dishes and
pans. Why, child, we have hit in a moment on the
solution of your difficulty.”</p>

<p>“You never have been used to an early dinner,”
said Frances in a troubled voice; “you would hate
it.”</p>

<p>“It could not really make the slightest difference to
me now,” declared the mother. “When I visited and
received visitors, things naturally were arranged according
to custom.”</p>

<p>“But, Mamma,” said Frances wistfully, “why should
you not visit again? The people worth knowing
wouldn’t like us a bit the less because we live in a
cottage instead of at Elveley. It is not as though we
had done anything wrong. All your favourite friends
have called since you have been here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Called!” interrupted Mrs. Morland vehemently
“yes&mdash;to pry into my affairs and gossip over my
changed circumstances. Ah! Frances, you don’t know
the world yet, thank Heaven; you look on it still with
a girl’s eyes, thoughtless and ignorant. No, you must
not attempt to question my judgment in such matters.
I could not endure to be pitied.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, Mamma.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t put your acquaintances to the test,”
said Mrs. Morland bitterly.</p>

<p>Frances looked up with clear, wondering eyes.</p>

<p>“Would you rather I did not go to our Altruist
meetings, then, Mamma? You know, I’ve joined our
little club again lately. Of course, all the girls understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
that I can be with them only once in a way, and
that I can’t make things for our stores, but they don’t
seem to mind.”</p>

<p>A smile of pleasure brightened the girl’s face as she
recalled the enthusiasm which had greeted her return
to the Altruists.</p>

<p>“By all means go to your meetings, child. It was
not by my wish that you left off doing so. And by
all means attend regularly, and get what fun you can
in your dull life. As to the work, you shall not be
entirely empty-handed. You and I will set up a
work-basket between us; and if we have no new
material, we can alter and cut down our own old
clothes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamma, that would be lovely!” said Frances
gratefully.</p>

<p>“I will look over your wardrobe this afternoon and
bring down some of the things you have quite outgrown.
And, my dear, I wish you to consider the
matter of our meals as settled. We will all dine
together, and we shall have nice long evenings. Why,
the Altruist work-basket will be a positive blessing to
me. You young people mustn’t be surprised if I pay
a visit to your study sometimes; it is just a little
lonely in my room after dark. I will sew while you
are busy with your lessons, and then we shall save a
fire. We might let the kitchen fire go out now and
then after tea, and keep one in the sitting-room, so
that we could have an hour or two’s music. James
has a nice voice&mdash;you must teach him to sing.” ...</p>

<p>“Mamma!&mdash;mamma darling!” Frances had flown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
to Mrs. Morland. Their cheeks were pressed together,
their arms were about one another.</p>

<p>“There&mdash;you silly child! I have been thinking the
old mother has been out of everything long enough.
Run away to your bedrooms; and before you go, lend
me your biggest apron. You shall see that I will
soon master the professional manner of washing
breakfast-cups.”</p>

<small>POLLY’S DELIVERER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Max,” said Dr. Brenton from the hall door, “can
you take a case for me this afternoon?” The
Doctor’s eyes twinkled as he spoke, for his son’s professional
aid furnished him with plenty of opportunity
for the harmless jesting enjoyed by both. “Of course,
I mean if your own private practice permits.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Max gravely; “I believe I’ve
nothing serious on. My distinguished services are
entirely at your disposal. Is it toothache or measles?
I’m great at measles.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I can’t give you a turn with your
speciality. It’s just a broken arm. But there was
some chance of fever; and the boy’s mother is such a
fool she can’t even take his temperature, or I might
have told her to send me word how he did&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but who’s the boy?”</p>

<p>“Oh! why, young Brown, at Appleton Farm.”</p>

<p>Max whistled. “Hallo! that’s a six-mile trot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and I don’t know how you’re to get there. I
can’t spare the trap, for I’ve to go twice as far in the
other direction.”</p>

<p>“Never mind ways and means,” said Max cheerily.
“As Appleton isn’t out of our planet, I suppose I can
reach it somehow.”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit, though, my boy,” said the Doctor,
stepping out on to the gravel path and laying his
hand on Max’s shoulder. “This is Wednesday, and I
don’t want to spoil any little plan for your friends’
holiday afternoon. Was there a spree in view?”</p>

<p>“Nothing you need bother about, Dad,” replied
Max, raising his bright face. “I was just going over
to Rowdon with this pansy-root for Frances. I forgot
to grub up the thing in the morning, so I’m getting it
now.”</p>

<p>“You always enjoy a few hours at Rowdon,” said
the Doctor regretfully. “Perhaps, after all, I might
get back in time to tackle Appleton myself.”</p>

<p>“No, you mightn’t. You’ll be tired enough as it is,
after being out half last night. Don’t you worry,
Dad, I’ll see to Brown.”</p>

<p>“It won’t matter how late you visit him. You
could have a game first, lad. Rowdon is not much off
the road to Appleton. Suppose you went there first?”</p>

<p>“Good idea! If Austin’s in trim, I dare say he’ll go
on with me. Frances too, maybe. Off you go, Dad,
and don’t fidget about Brown. I’ll settle him and his
temperature.”</p>

<p>So off the Doctor went, as easy in his mind as his
young son’s care could make him. And Max dug up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
his root, wrapped it neatly in brown paper, and made
ready for the tramp to Rowdon.</p>

<p>Austin was “in trim” and volunteered his company
to Appleton. Frances and her mother had arranged
to give the afternoon to the Altruist work-basket;
but they invited Max to come back to tea at the
cottage, and to play a game at cricket on the Common
afterwards. The boys did their walk in good time,
found Brown’s temperature normal and his arm doing
well, and then strolled homeward at a leisurely pace.</p>

<p>“How are things going in the village?” inquired
Austin, as they neared Rowdon, and topics of more
personal interest had been pretty well exhausted.
“Has your father got old Fenn to do anything for
Lumber’s Yard?”</p>

<p>“Fenn! Not he. But the folks themselves are
looking up. Carlyon has been hammering away at
them a long time, as you know, and most of them
are a shade more respectable in consequence. At
least, they are beginning to show some disgust with
that beast Baker, which is a sign of a return to
decency.”</p>

<p>“Has Baker been doing anything fresh lately?”</p>

<p>“Anything fresh in the way of brutality is hardly
within Mr. Joe Baker’s power. He’s an out-and-out
right-down waster, and I told him so yesterday for
the fiftieth time.”</p>

<p>“What was he doing?”</p>

<p>“Mauling that tiny mite Polly. Fortunately Harry
the Giant heard the child yell, and went to her help
just as I got there. I couldn’t help treating Baker to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
a few home truths, and I wish you’d seen his scowls
and heard the pleasant things he promised me.”</p>

<p>“Beast! But I say, Max, don’t put yourself in his
way in a lonely lane on a dark night. He doesn’t
love you.”</p>

<p>Max’s expressive “Ugh!” closed the subject.</p>

<p>The tea-table, presided over by Mrs. Morland, was
surrounded that evening by a lively little company.
Austin and Max gave a mirthful version of their
encounter with Mrs. Brown, concerning the beef-tea
they had ventured to criticise; and quiet Jim, whose
sense of humour was undergoing cultivation, chuckled
over the boys’ small witticisms. Max’s long walk had
not robbed cricket of attraction. As soon as tea had
been cleared away, the youngsters dragged Jim off to
the Common; and even Mrs. Morland was cajoled into
coming with them to look on and keep the score.</p>

<p>But it was a really tired-out lad who, when dusk
was deepening into darkness, bade Frances and Austin
good-bye on the further side of the Common. Max
would not let his friends come further, for he meant
to cover a good part of the remaining distance at a
swinging trot, which might, he hoped, compel his
aching legs to do their duty. And for a time they
did it nobly; but presently fatigue compelled the boy
to slow down to a steady walk, which made reflection
easier. Max’s thoughts were usually good company,
and on this particular evening he had abundant food
for them.</p>

<p>Max Brenton was nearing his fifteenth birthday,
and his busy, capable life held promise of early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
maturity. Though still a very boyish boy, he had in
his many quiet hours developed a power of concentration
and resolute temper, which inclined him to wider
schemes of activity than boyhood often learns to contemplate.
It was only the strength and depth of his
affections&mdash;in which alone Max was child-like&mdash;that
rendered it possible for him to look forward without
impatience to a career consecrated to the service of
Woodend.</p>

<p>Max would have preferred a broader outlook and a
brisker scene for his energies. But he knew that a
partnership with his son was Dr. Brenton’s wildest
dream of future happiness and prosperity, and Max
could not imagine himself bringing defeat to his
father’s plan. How often had they talked it over
together! and how gaily had Max anticipated his
triumphant return to his little country home with the
honours of the schools bound thick about his brows!
By that time Dad would want someone to do the
night-work, and share the responsibility of difficult
cases; and who should help him, who ever had helped
him, but Max?</p>

<p>The boy smiled as, moving rapidly through the
evening darkness, he reminded himself afresh of all
these things. Then the smile faded, and a quick
sigh expressed the lurking regret of his growing
years. For a while his thoughts soared to all conceivable
heights of medical distinction; and he wondered
whether, had his path not been inexorably
prepared for him, he might have climbed to better
purpose some other way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>Max’s thoughts still dwelt lingeringly on the opportunities
present-day conditions afford to the specialist
in any profession, as he drew within sight of the
straggling cottages of Woodend village. The first of
all was a neat little one-storeyed tenement, where
dwelt poor Mrs. Baker’s aged father and mother. Of
late the couple had often tried to shelter Bell and her
little ones during outbreaks of Joe Baker’s drunken
fury; and more than once the fugitives had been
pursued to their place of refuge by their persecutor.
Max recalled these facts while his eyes caught through
the trees the glimmer of lights below him in the valley;
and by a natural sequence of thought, he remembered
also his morning encounter with Joe.</p>

<p>“He was in one of his worst moods,” meditated the
boy; “and if the ‘Jolly Dog’ has seen any more of
him since, I expect his wife will be in danger to-night.
I declare, I’ve half a mind to look in on her father
and give him a word of warning. He might fetch
the children, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Max looked again at the light in old Baring’s
distant window, and decided to carry out his plan.
A little further on he turned into the lane where,
many months ago, Austin Morland’s galloping pony
had caught up “brother Jim”. The overhanging trees
behind tall wooden palings added to the natural darkness
of the hour and place; and it was not till his eyes
had grown accustomed to the gloom that he detected
a tiny figure stumbling towards him up the path.
When the child came close, Max saw that it was little
five-year-old Polly Baker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>“Hallo!” sang out Max; “you again, small kid!
What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mas’r Max! Mas’r Max!” The child flung
herself at the lad, and clung to him desperately. “He’s
after me, Father is! Don’t let him have me! Please
don’t, Mas’r Max!”</p>

<p>The boy lifted the little child in his arms, and tried
to soothe her. He felt that her frail body was palpitating
with the terror which had already made her
baby face wizened and old. A mighty wrath surged
into Max’s heart. Polly’s trembling fingers tugging
weakly at his jacket called all his manliest instincts
into vigour.</p>

<p>He easily made out the child’s broken words of
explanation. Baker had been turned away from the
“Jolly Dog” as being dangerous to its other frequenters,
and in malicious rage had lurched home and
set about beating wife and children indiscriminately.
Neighbours had come to the rescue, and had seen
that Bell was safely housed with a friend, while her
children were sent under escort to their grandfather
Baring. For a time Baker had remained indoors,
nursing his wrongs; then, not daring to interfere with
Bell, since Harry the Giant was mounting guard over
her, he had set out in the dark to wreak his fury on
the Barings and their helpless charges.</p>

<p>His coming had sent Polly and the other little ones
into paroxysms of terror, and they had flown for
shelter out to the friendly night. Baker was drunk
enough to be dangerous, without having in the least
lost control over his senses. Little Polly, whose baby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
fist had sometimes been raised in defence of her
mother, was always his favourite victim; and the
child now gasped in Max’s ear her certainty that her
father had seen and followed her. If he had been
sure she was right, Max would have turned instantly,
and have run back up the lane to some trusty villager’s
dwelling; but before he could persuade himself to
this course, events proved Polly’s fear to be justified.
Round the corner into the lane came Baker, running
at full speed, with sufficient certainty of gait to assure
Max that he would have no helpless drunkard to deal
with.</p>

<p>Even then, Max knew that he could escape, without
Polly. Max was fleet of foot; but the clinging grasp
of the childish fingers and the weight of the little
quivering body were enough to give the advantage to
Baker in an uphill race. Max had but a minute for
reflection, and he determined to try to dodge Baker,
slip past him, and make a dash for the village.
Running downhill, he thought he might outstrip the
enemy, should he give chase; and there would be
the chance of meeting help in the more frequented
road.</p>

<p>Max had hardly resolved on the attempt, when he
knew it had failed. Baker made a cunning feint of
speeding by, then flung himself to one side and fairly
pinned Max against the palings. In a twinkling the
boy had twisted himself free, and set down his burden
with a whispered “Run for it, Polly! Run back to
the village, fast!”</p>

<p>Max’s fear was all for the baby girl, and his one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
thought now was to gain time for her escape. Therefore
he made no attempt to secure his own, but threw
all his strength into the effort to hold back Polly’s
father, who, with threats which chilled Max’s blood,
addressed thickly to the flying child, was trying to
hurl himself after her. The strong young arms of
Polly’s defender were not so easily shaken off; and as
the little flickering feet carried their owner round the
corner and out of sight, Baker turned his attention to
revenge.</p>

<p>Max’s vigour was already nearly spent, and his
danger had been obvious to him from the beginning of
the unequal struggle. Baker’s hatred of “the young
Doc”, first called into active existence on the night
when the boy’s manœuvres had successfully combated
his own brutal designs, had increased continually ever
since. It was Max’s interference, and Max’s personal
popularity, which had made the denizens of Lumber’s
Yard band themselves into a sort of bodyguard to
protect Baker’s ill-used wife and children. It was Max
who had again and again assailed the drunkard and
bully with words of biting contempt. It was Max
who had that very morning boldly threatened to
obtain legal redress for Bell and her little ones should
their cruel tyrant persecute them once more.</p>

<p>Now the man had the boy in his power. Max could
not do much in self-defence. He tried to hit out, but
Baker, seizing his arms, flung him back against the
fence, and, pinning him there with one hand, struck at
him furiously with the other. Even then Max’s thoughts
were with the escaping child, and he clung desperately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
to the arm which held him during the few moments of
blinding pain before he dropped. Baker was not made
of the stuff which spares a fallen foe. His heavy
nailed boots did a ruffian’s work on the prostrate body
of Max Brenton.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Little Polly fled as for dear life along the village
road. She passed her grandfather’s house, which had
proved so poor a shelter; she gave no heed to bystanders
at cottage-gates; she did not dare to pause
even when a friendly voice addressed her. Deep in
her baby heart was a fear, not for herself alone; and
she flew on and on, her fluttering breath panting between
her white lips, her scared eyes gleaming with
terror above her colourless cheeks. Her way soon led
her by large houses set far back in their beautiful
gardens, and at the gate of one of these a boy stood
waiting for a comrade.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Polly! What’s the scare, youngster? Stop,
and let’s hear.”</p>

<p>Every Altruist was Polly’s friend, and knew the
story of her wretched home. So now at last the child
ventured to check her headlong pace, and to give voice
to her baby fears. This lad, she knew, was Guy
Gordon&mdash;he who could make cunning use of the
strange silver flute, he whose pockets kept stores of
sweets for tiny, crimson-frocked girls. Guy was the
friend of Polly’s young deities&mdash;Max and Austin,
Frances and Florry. To him the child now turned
with a despairing cry.</p>

<p>“Mas’r Max! Oh, it’s Mas’r Max!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>“No, it’s Mas’r Guy!” laughed the boy good-naturedly.
“What’s up, Trots?”</p>

<p>“Save him, p’ease save Mas’r Max! Father’s got
him in the dark lane far away. Father’ll kill Mas’r
Max!”</p>

<p>“Polly! What!&mdash;what do you mean, child? Your
father, and Max! Where?”</p>

<p>Guy knew, like the rest of his small world, the
hatred felt by Baker for the Doctor’s son; and while
the boy tried to assure himself that there was no use
in heeding incoherent babble from a mere baby like
Polly, a horrible dread swept across his mind.</p>

<p>“Father’s got him! Oh, Father’s got Mas’r Max!
Father hates Mas’r Max ’cos he won’t let him beat
Mummy and me! Father’ll kill Mas’r Max away in
the dark lane, ’cos&mdash;’cos Mas’r Max held Father to let
Polly run!”</p>

<p>“It can’t be true! Polly, are you certain you mean
just what you say? Oh, what’s the use of asking her!
I’ll do something on the chance&mdash;”</p>

<p>Guy thought a moment, then, picking up the child,
ran at his best speed up the road to Dr. Brenton’s
house, now close at hand.</p>

<p>“Me was comin’ here!” sobbed Polly, as Guy pelted
in at the gate; “me was comin’ to tell Dokker! Polly
love Dokker and Mas’r Max. Polly not let Mas’r Max
be killed dead!”</p>

<p>“You poor little brave thing!” muttered Guy, choking
back a sob himself. “If anything has happened to
Max, what will the Doctor do? He is in, I know. I
saw him go home just half an hour ago. Where’s the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
bell? Ugh! how my hand shakes! I’m no better than
this baby.”</p>

<p>The Doctor was in, heard Guy’s story, and keeping
over his voice and face a control which amazed his
boy-visitor, questioned Polly so quietly and gently
that he drew from her an account clear enough as to
time and place, and connected enough as to fact, to
convince himself and Guy that the little one told the
truth. Then he called Janet, handed Polly into her
care, and caught up his hat and a thick stick.</p>

<p>Dr. Brenton and Guy ran down the road, side by
side, at a level, steady trot. Guy kept respectful and
sympathetic silence. He, like Polly, loved the good
Doctor and Max.</p>

<p>Suddenly Guy drew from his pocket a whistle, on
which he blew a loud and shrill blast.</p>

<p>“It’s the Altruists’ whistle, sir,” he explained briefly.
“Of course we won’t wait, but if there are any of
‘Ours’ about, they’ll turn up and help.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, lad,” said the Doctor. “We’ll pray as we
go that Max has escaped from that scoundrel.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t try,” said Guy simply, “while Polly
was about.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” said the Doctor, and they sped on.</p>

<p>Guy’s whistle roused the echoes. Down the garden-paths
and the shadowy drives of the larger dwellings
of Woodend rushed a half-score of Altruists, responsive
to the well-known signal, and eager to know what had
brought it forth. For this particular whistle was never
used save when opportunity offered for the Society’s
members to justify their motto, “Help Others”. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
running boys soon caught up the Doctor and Guy, and
heard from the latter, in his breathless undertones,
what the signal had meant. The lads felt themselves
in sufficient force to deliver Max from any danger;
and as the village road was now empty of all save
stragglers hieing homeward, they attracted no particular
attention.</p>

<p>“There’s Harry the Giant!” exclaimed Frank Temple,
who ran beside Guy just in the Doctor’s wake. “He
might be of use&mdash;I’ll bring him.”</p>

<p>The name of Max sufficed for Harry, who attached
himself willingly to the little group of boys. Then
in silence they followed the Doctor out of the village,
along the uphill country road, and so into the long,
dark lane, which Polly’s description had enabled Dr.
Brenton to identify. Half-way up the lane they came
upon Max, lying, as Baker had left him, in the deep
shadow of the trees.</p>

<p>All the lads waited silently while the father knelt
down to examine his son.</p>

<p>“I think he is alive, Guy,” said Dr. Brenton presently,
while he turned to his young allies a white and
agonized face; “if he is, that’s the most I can say&mdash;and
I’m not sure yet. Come, you all cared for him;
you shall help me to carry him home.”</p>

<p>The boys pressed forward, but Harry, stepping
quickly in front of them, stooped and raised Max
carefully in his mighty arms.</p>

<p>“By your leave, gen’lemen,” said the big, good-hearted
fellow, “there’s none but me as shall carry
Master Max.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>
<p>And after that there was for Polly’s deliverer a long
and dreamless night.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<small>WANTED&mdash;A NICE SOMEBODY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When Max again looked out on the world with
seeing eyes, he was lying upon his own bed, a
fact which for the moment puzzled him exceedingly.
Because cool air and soft sunshine were coming in at
the open window; and while it was yet day, Max had
been wont to work. As he still scolded himself lazily
for a good-for-nothing lie-abed, and almost resolved to
rise that very minute, his blinking eyes caught sight
of a dark mass which resolved itself slowly into the
definite shape of humanity, and became the motionless
figure of a man.</p>

<p>“Dad!”</p>

<p>The figure moved, rose, came forward with the
painful caution of dreary suspense. Dr. Brenton had
doubted his ears, and Max’s eyelids were together
again. But gradually they parted, tardily but surely,
and Max’s lips smiled.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="i-269" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-269.png" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>M432</p>
<p class="center">“THE FIGURE MOVED, ROSE, CAME FORWARD WITH THE
PAINFUL CAUTION OF DREARY SUSPENSE.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>The boy heard a low-breathed murmur of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“Dad!”</p>

<p>“Ah!&mdash;Max!...”</p>

<p>Round the corner of a big screen near the door came
the eager face of a boy. Just one peep at that other
boyish face on the pillow, and then Austin’s vanished.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
A minute later its owner, on shoeless feet, was dancing
a wild jig of enthusiasm on the landing outside. For
the great London specialist, Sir Gerald Turner, had
said that if, within a certain time, Max recovered consciousness,
there might be a chance for his life. And
Austin had firm faith in that “chance”.</p>

<p>Sir Gerald had found it convenient to spend a
country holiday with his brother, Betty’s father, and
might be relied on to be within hail. Max’s case was
interesting, and Sir Gerald liked Dr. Brenton. So now
Austin, with one brief word to Janet, found his boots,
dragged them on somehow, and flew to summon the
famous physician. Sir Gerald came at a pace which
tried Austin’s patience to the last degree; but as the
man was not to be hurried, the boy ran in advance,
and wondered as he went what it could feel like to
give a verdict for life or death.</p>

<p>Dr. Brenton came to meet his coadjutor, and led him
upstairs. The two friends, speaking in whispers, passed
out of Austin’s ken. Then the boy, studying his watch,
learned that Sir Gerald could actually be heartless
enough to keep him in horrible uncertainty for a good
ten minutes, and wondered how London could produce
and tolerate such a monster. The distant hum of voices
heard murmuringly through Max’s window overhead
was so intolerable that Austin covered his ears with his
hands as he rocked to and fro on the doorstep. Thus
he was taken by surprise when a hand was laid kindly
on his shoulder, and a voice said gently:</p>

<p>“Be comforted, my boy. Your playfellow is better:
he is going to pull through.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>Austin’s wild shout of joy made Max stir in his
health-giving sleep; but after all it did no harm, and
carried to a little knot of waiting Altruists the first
glad prophecy of better things to come.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Max improved slowly, and at length reached a point
of improvement beyond which he seemed unable to
go. No one was more disturbed than he that this
should be the case. His father was palpably uneasy
at leaving him, and yet work must be attended to.
His own pensioners were doubtless in need of him,
though the entire body of Altruists had placed themselves
unreservedly at his service.</p>

<p>Through the cloudless days of a beautiful May the
Doctor’s son struggled back to life, and learned afresh
how sweet a thing it was. He never was lonely, for
some boy or girl was always at hand to look after
food and medicines, tell stories, and invite orders. On
his own behalf Max was not exigent; but his comrades
found out, during those days of vicarious work among
the sick and sorry of Woodend, how busy a person
“the young Doc” had become, and how many of his
glad boyish hours must have been given freely to the
helping of others.</p>

<p>“Max was an Altruist long before we started our
Society,” remarked Frances meditatively. “I don’t
know how he managed to do all he did.”</p>

<p>“‘Busy people always have most time,’” said Betty
sententiously.</p>

<p>“Will Max ever be busy again, I wonder?” questioned
Florry. “Oh, poor Max!&mdash;if he doesn’t get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
well! I heard Dr. Brenton tell Papa that Max didn’t
get on a bit, and that he had been so badly hurt.&mdash;Oh,
Frances! wasn’t it cruel?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but Max is a hero, and we’re proud of him.
And he’s quite brave about it. If he fretted, he
wouldn’t have half so good a chance; but since he’s
plucky and quiet he will surely get well some day.
Meanwhile, we can take care of all his ‘cases’.&mdash;I
dressed a burn to-day,” finished Frances triumphantly.
“The child had come to see Max&mdash;just fancy&mdash;and I
took him in, and Max showed me how to do it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll start an ambulance class, and beg Dr. Brenton
to teach us,” said Betty. “I should like it. I’m
going to be a doctor some day, and live in Harley
Street, and be rich and famous, and cure all the people
nobody else can cure;&mdash;I’ll be just like Uncle Gerald.”</p>

<p>“And Florry will be rich and famous too,” sighed
Frances; “she’ll write hooks and plays and be as
great an author as you will be a doctor. Oh, dear! I
sha’n’t be anybody particular. I’ll just have to stay at
home and help Max with his easy cases.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you something more about Max,” said
Betty. “Uncle Gerald says Dr. Brenton ought to
send him away yachting with somebody who would
take great care of him, and then he would get well a
great deal sooner. I’m on the look-out for a nice
Somebody to do it. I’ve a cousin who has a yacht, and
I wrote to him, and what do you think the wretch
replied? ‘Catch me plaguing myself with an invalid
boy!’ I sha’n’t speak to him when he comes here
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>“I wouldn’t,” said Florry, with equal determination.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know Max,” said Frances.</p>

<p>“We will ask all the Altruists to ‘look out for a
nice Somebody’ to take Max a sea-voyage,” said
Florry. “I dare say we shall soon find someone.
Now, good-bye, girls; it’s my turn to be nurse. I’ve a
lovely story by Stanley Weyman to read to Max, and
I’m aching to begin it.”</p>

<p>If the care and service of his friends could have
cured the sick boy he would have made a wonderfully
quick recovery. As it was, they certainly helped him
loyally through the long days of his pain and weakness;
and the persistent cheerfulness of their prophecies
as to his future coloured insensibly his own
thoughts, and made them usually bright and always
contented. Then, though the details of Baker’s capture
by a band of Woodend villagers, and his exemplary
punishment at their hands, were still withheld from
him, he had the relief of knowing that the brutal rascal
of Lumber’s Yard had been packed off to America,
with a threat of legal proceedings should he dare to
reappear in Woodend; and that Bell Baker, free of his
tyranny, was developing into a good mother and tidy
housewife. Max’s friends found her as much work as
she could do; and the Altruists helped her judiciously
with extra food and clothing for her little ones.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Woodend gentlemen held a meeting,
at which they said many pleasant things about the
Doctor’s son, and many serious ones about the condition
of the worst part of their village. Edward Carlyon
gave his testimony; and it was resolved to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
attempt the purchase of Lumber’s Yard. This plan
was actually carried out almost immediately; and a
few months later the “Jolly Dog” and the surrounding
wretched dwellings were pulled down, and Lumber’s
Yard was no more. Instead, the proud villagers beheld
a row of pretty cottages about an open green;
and to the small colony was given, by universal vote,
the name of young Max Brenton.</p>

<small>LESSING OF LESSING’S CREEK.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Things are looking up, or else the world is coming
to an end. Jim has a visitor.”</p>

<p>“Truly?”</p>

<p>“On my word of honour. I say, Frances, he’s such
a quaint chap to look at.”</p>

<p>“Somebody else is quaint to look at. I hope you
weren’t in your shirt-sleeves when you answered the
door?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;hardly. I believe I wore a complete shirt,
likewise a pair of breeks.”</p>

<p>“Run away, boy. I’m busy.”</p>

<p>“So am I&mdash;awful. But in the goodness of my
heart I just looked in to bring you the news. The
fellow told me his name was Tom Lessing, of Lessing’s
Creek Farm, Douglas River, Australia. Pretty wide
address. He asked for Jim, and said Jim would be
sure to see him, so I sent him along to the smithy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
But first, as I didn’t want to miss a chance, I inquired
if he had happened to meet Mr. Walter Keith&mdash;thinking
that he would have run across Cousin Walter as
likely as not. But he hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“That was remarkable. Australia, as you observed,
is a wide address.”</p>

<p>“Well, there was no harm in asking. I hope Jim
will invite Tom Lessing, of Lessing’s Creek Farm, to
dinner. I’d love to hear a backwoodsman talk. I’d
love to go to Australia. Isn’t it odd of Jim not to
long to be a colonist? He says he wouldn’t like it a
bit.”</p>

<p>“Cousin Walter hasn’t particularly enjoyed being a
colonist, Master Adventurous.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s because he didn’t learn a trade before
he went, and because he didn’t understand sheep-farming,
and because he’s a bit of a duffer all round!
Now, Jim’s got a kernel in his nut&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Austin!”</p>

<p>“Well, brains in his cranium, then. I’m off to peep
in on Tom Lessing, of Lessing’s Creek Farm.”</p>

<p>“No, dear, don’t. Perhaps he and Jim are old
friends.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are. He said so. He said a jolly lot in
two minutes, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“Then I wouldn’t pry, Austin. They may have a
great deal to tell each other.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t pry. I’ll just stroll past the smithy.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were so fearfully busy?”</p>

<p>“So I am. I’m busy keeping you posted up in the
latest intelligence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“Mamma wants some peas gathered. Get them for
her, there’s a dear.”</p>

<p>“None of your blarney! You want to watch over
my manners by keeping me in sight. Not a bit!
Tom Lessing, like a magnet, lures me to Lessing’s
Creek Farm, Douglas River, Australia.”</p>

<p>Austin walked with dignity out by the backdoor,
but presently put his head in again, and remarked:</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll gather the peas&mdash;enough for five!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Morland was seated shelling peas in the
orchard,&mdash;it was a warm June morning,&mdash;when her
stepson, walking quickly over the short, sweet-smelling
grass, came to her side.</p>

<p>“Can you spare a minute?” he asked with his old
nervousness. The sight of his stepmother taking part
in the day’s household work always increased his
uneasy sense of his own shortcomings.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Have you anything to tell me, James?”</p>

<p>“Just that an old friend has come to see me, and is
still here. He’s waiting for me in the smithy. Tom
Lessing and I used to be great chums once on a time,
though his people were better off than mine. He
went out to Australia four years ago, and he has done
very well.” Mrs. Morland heard a slight sigh. “He
always was a very capable chap, and he has a splendid
farm out there now. I&mdash;I think the children would
like him; he has seen such a lot. Please, would you
mind very much if I kept him to dinner?”</p>

<p>“Is he very rough? I do not mean to hurt you,
James; but you know I have Frances to think of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>“I would not let a rough fellow come near the
children,” said Jim in gentle reproach.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no. I am sure you would not. Then, pray
keep your friend. I will help Frances to prepare
something extra, and he shall be made welcome.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” said Jim gratefully.
“Tom has come to England for a holiday, and he is
going to take lodgings in Exham for a few days, so
that we may see something of each other. I should
not wish him to come here, Mrs. Morland,” added Jim
simply, “if you were afraid for the children; but,
indeed, Tom is a nice fellow, and I think you will not
dislike him.”</p>

<p>The last words proved true. Tom Lessing had not
long been in Mrs. Morland’s presence before she had
decided that she liked him very much. He was
several years older than her stepson, and as big and
strong as Jim was slight and active. He treated Jim’s
“lady-folk” with courteous deference, and was evidently
able to polish his “backwoodsman” manners
for fit converse in an English home. The dinner
passed off pleasantly, Jim and Austin distinguishing
themselves as waiters. The visitor enjoyed everything,
and behaved in an easy, natural fashion which
had nothing vulgar about it. Mrs. Morland reflected
that her stepson must have followed some wise instinct
in the choice of his boyhood’s friends.</p>

<p>That dinner was the first of several meals shared
by Tom with his old chum, and his chum’s kindred.
Privately, he declared that Jim was a lucky chap to
have proved his right to claim relationship with such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
a bright, plucky little pair as his lately-discovered
brother and sister; and then he added a few words in
acknowledgment of Mrs. Morland’s courteous welcome,
which made Jim happier than anything. Besides
sharing meals, Tom found himself made free of the
smithy, where he held exhaustive discussions with
Jim, and of the orchard, where he romped with
Austin, to the latter’s great content.</p>

<p>During the old friends’ exchange of confidences and
record of experiences, Jim was lured into expressions
of feeling with regard to his kindred which made
good-hearted Tom look on the lad with kindly and
pitying eyes. With him, overwrought Jim felt he
might venture to unbosom himself of his anxieties and
ambitions concerning the future. Jim’s desired course
of action tended in only one way&mdash;the proper maintenance,
in ease and comfort, of his stepmother and
sister, and the careful training of his brother with a
view to Austin’s adoption of some honourable profession.
While uttering his aspirations, Jim revealed to
his attentive chum the reality of his pride in the girl
and boy who depended on him, and his deep affection
for them. Tom listened and pondered, and made up
his mind. His liking for “young East” had always
been something more than mere boyish comradeship;
and the respect and sympathy with which he quietly
noted Jim’s hard and continual effort to live up to his
own high standard of duty now added to Tom’s former
easy liking the deeper regard of his maturer years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One morning Frances, wandering through the orchard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
for a breath of cool air, came suddenly on Jim,
who was lying at full length on the bank in the
shadow of the hedge, his head pillowed on his folded
arms. There was something so forlorn in the lad’s
attitude that Frances feared some fresh trouble had
overtaken him; and she was not surprised that his
face, when he raised it in answer to her call, was
darkened by a deep dejection.</p>

<p>“Jim&mdash;Jim! What is the matter? Now, it’s no
use to try to hide things, Jim! You know it isn’t.
Just tell me.”</p>

<p>Jim dragged himself up to his sister’s level as she
sat down beside him, and his eyes rested very wistfully
on her inquiring face. So long and sad was his
gaze that the girl grew yet more uncomfortable, and
repeated her question insistently.</p>

<p>“I’ve no bad news for you, Missy,” said Jim at last,
with great effort. “None that you will find bad, at
least. I have heard something, and I’ve been thinking
it over; that’s all. If I weren’t a coward, it wouldn’t
have wanted any thinking.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, Jim?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you presently, Missy. As well now as
any time; only I’d like your mother and the lad to
hear too.”</p>

<p>“Jim,” said Frances, her brave voice quivering
slightly, “you speak as though your news were
bad.”</p>

<p>“That’s just my selfishness,” muttered Jim; “I
couldn’t see all at once the rights of things. I can see
now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>“Come indoors and tell us all about it,” said Frances,
trying to speak cheerfully; “not much news grows
better by keeping.”</p>

<p>“It could be only a matter of hours for this, anyway,”
replied Jim gently; “and if your mother is at
liberty and Austin is at home, I will do as you
wish.”</p>

<p>So Frances led the way, and the pair walked soberly
to the little house which had become to both a
cherished home.</p>

<p>Jim waited at the back-door while his sister went
to look for her mother and brother, and finding them
both in the study, sharing the window-seat, and the
task of snipping gooseberries, ran back to summon the
“head of the family”.</p>

<p>All the responsibility of headship was in the lad’s
countenance as he entered the study in his sister’s
wake. He stood silent while Frances, in brief fashion,
explained the situation; but something in her stepson’s
look caught and held Mrs. Morland’s attention,
and made her suspect that a tragedy might underlie
Jim’s unusual calmness. She could not guess how
hard he had striven to reach the degree of composure
necessary to satisfy his stepmother’s ideal of good
breeding.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve something to tell,” he said, when Frances
paused, “and I hope it will mean a real difference to
you all. I had no right to look forward to such a
chance as I have had given me, and I know you’ll
wonder at it too&mdash;”</p>

<p>“James,” interrupted Mrs. Morland, with an acute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
glance, “you don’t look as though the chance were
altogether welcome.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I told him,” said Frances brightly.
“He pretends to bring good news, but I believe he’s a
deceiver.”</p>

<p>Jim flushed slightly, and hung his head. “You must
please forgive me,” he murmured, “if I seem ungrateful
and selfish. Indeed, I want to see how everything’s
for the best. I’ll be quick now, and tell my news.
You know Tom Lessing has a fine place in Australia,
and is making money fast. He has a lot of hands,
and seems to pay them well; and he gives every one
of them a share in his profits over and above their
salaries. Tom is very kind, and&mdash;you’ve all been
good and kind to him, for which we both thank
you.”</p>

<p>Though Jim spoke earnestly, there was an aloofness
in his manner which touched all his listeners,
and reminded them, with keen shame, what scanty
cause he had, even now, to feel himself one of them.
Frances impulsively moved a step nearer him, and
stopped, overcome by the constraint she could not
disguise; Austin sprang to his brother’s side, and
pressed affectionately against him. Jim gently held
him off, as though the lad’s caresses threatened his
own self-control; but his hand kept the boy within
reach, and once or twice passed tenderly over Austin’s
tumbled curly head. If Mrs. Morland ever had
doubted her stepson’s love for her children, the suspicion
from that moment died away.</p>

<p>“Because he is kind, and because you have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
good to him,” continued Jim, “Tom has given me a
chance. He has offered to take me back with him to
Australia, and to find me a good place as one of his
overseers. He says I’d soon learn enough to be of use,
and he’d help me to get on. I should have two
hundred and fifty a year; and as I’d live with him,
he’d give me board and lodging too. So, since I
shouldn’t want much for clothes, I could send nearly
all my earnings home; and there would be grandfather’s
money as well, and we would sell the smithy.
I’ve been thinking you might have a little house in
Woodend, and the children would go to school again,
and by and by Austin would go to college. I hope
you would be very happy.”</p>

<p>The speaker’s lips trembled for just a second, in
evidence of full heart and highly-strung nerves. Then
Jim, with courageous eyes, looked across the room for
comments and congratulations.</p>

<p>“We should be very happy?” queried Frances; and
this time she went close to her brother, and took his
hand. “Oh, Jim!” she exclaimed, her eyes bright with
tears; “don’t go away from us, dear Jim!”</p>

<p>“You sha’n’t go away&mdash;so that’s all about it!”
cried Austin, with a masterful toss of his fair head.
“You sha’n’t oversee anybody, except us. It’s tommy-rot.”</p>

<p>“We are happy now,” continued Frances in trembling
haste. “We don’t want any more money, if
we can’t have it without giving you up to Australia.
What’s the use of having found you, Jim, if you go
away again?”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="i-283" style="max-width: 28em;">

WE WOULD LET YOU GO.”</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>Boy and girl, on either side, were clinging tightly
to him. Jim, trying to be calm&mdash;trying to be brave&mdash;looked
desperately to his stepmother for her expected
support. If she should quench Austin and Frances
with some cynical reproof&mdash;if she should accept Jim’s
final sacrifice with just a word of contemptuous indifference&mdash;surely
his pride would help his judgment
to keep fast hold of his failing courage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morland had already risen, and was coming
towards him now with hands outstretched, and in her
face the light of a motherly love to which Jim could
not try to be blind.</p>

<p>“Would you really do that for us?” she asked, smiling,
though her voice was not quite steady. “Ah! but
you would make such a mistake if you thought we
would let you go. Frances is right;&mdash;we can do without
wealth, but we can’t do without you!”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<small>TO THE FAR SOUTH.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“And so you want me to go back to Australia alone?
But, my dear madam, consider. Though I say
it, this is a really first-rate opening for Jim&mdash;and
remember the advantage to your own children. You
won’t think me impertinent, will you, for what may
seem a cool sort of interference in your affairs? You
and all your family have been so kind to me that I
can’t help taking a warm interest in your children;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
and as for Jim&mdash;I think he’s first-rate. I quite admit
that, in wanting him, I’ve a selfish regard for my own
concerns.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there’s an atom of selfishness about
you, Mr. Lessing,” replied Mrs. Morland, speaking
slowly and very sincerely. “I am not in the least
offended by your frank speech, for I appreciate to the
full all you say about my children. Among ‘my children’,
you must please include Jim; and when I say
that your opinion of him is also mine, I think you will
see why I want to keep him with me. He is willing
to endure exile for the sake of his sister and brother;
but I no longer think, as I’m afraid I did once, that Jim
ought to give all and receive nothing. Frances and
Austin are not afraid of work, and are anxious to do
all they can to ease the load which, as you know, at
present lies chiefly on their brother. By and by they
will relieve him more. No, Mr. Lessing, we can’t part
with Jim. To be plain, we are indebted to you for
teaching us how much we need him.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s all right,” returned Tom heartily, “and
glad am I to hear it. I didn’t take long to see that
the foolish lad was breaking his heart because he
fancied the young folks and you would just as soon
be without him. So, thought I, let Jim put it to the
test: if he’s right, he’ll do better to make a fresh start
and learn to stand alone; if he’s wrong, he’ll be a
happy fellow when he discovers it. There, you’ll
forgive me, won’t you? I meant my offer straight
enough, and I mean it still. It rests with you whether
Jim has a way made clear for him, or whether he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
hasn’t. He won’t leave you and the children. Well
and good: let you and the children come with him.
A minute more&mdash;best allow me to say my say, and
then you’ll find it easier to answer. My place out
there is not so lonely that you need fear to be beyond
civilization. There’s Douglas Town near at hand, with
good schools and the rest, and plenty of nice folk of a
sort you could make friends with. Then the air is dry
and bracing&mdash;just the thing for your boy. Lastly,&mdash;and
this is a bit personal, maybe,&mdash;if you and the young
people came out with Jim, you’d find a home ready-made.
The Creek Farm badly wants a mistress, and
I’d be proud to see you reign there, and grateful too.
I’m not a marrying man&mdash;now. I had my dream;&mdash;you’ll
not think the worse of me, Mrs. Morland,&mdash;it’s
over. But I can fancy what a difference it would
make out yonder, if there were a kindly, gracious
gentlewoman in authority. As for Miss Frances, she’d
just be the light of the place. Last of all, I’d like to
say that our exile&mdash;for so it is to every son of Old
England&mdash;needn’t be for always. When Jim and I
had made our pile,&mdash;and we’d try to be quick about
it,&mdash;we’d all come home again; in time, maybe, for
Austin to keep his terms at Oxford. Well, that’s all
I need trouble you with for a first start; details can
follow. I think you know enough to be able to decide.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Morland’s decision was not arrived at all at once,
or without some serious deliberations with her “trio”.
They were all old enough to comprehend both the
advantages and disadvantages of the plan proposed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
Lessing; but Austin’s delight at the prospect of becoming
a “backwoodsman” was not to be damped by the
assurance that in Australia, as in England, he would
have to be just a schoolboy for a good while yet.
The only regret of the two youngest of the family
was the anticipation of a long parting from friends
tried and true; but various circumstances rendered
this outlook less dismal than it might have been.
Florry Fane and her parents were going to the
Normandy aunt for a lengthy stay; Guy Gordon and
Frank Temple were bound for Harrow next term;
Betty Turner and the First Violin were at the same
date to become pupils of Miss Cliveden at Haversfield
College.</p>

<p>And Max? Well, Max’s movements were decided
for him by Frances at the outset of the family deliberations.</p>

<p>“A voyage to Australia! The very thing for Max!
And we could keep him out there until he was quite
well and strong, and bring him back in time for
college with Austin!”</p>

<p>“Yes, we must have Max,” declared Lessing, who
had given a good many hours to the entertainment of
Woodend’s petted “hero”, and accounted himself a
favoured friend of the young Doctor and the old.
“And why shouldn’t his father come too? I’d
guarantee him plenty of practice: we’d give our ears
for an English medical man out there. I’ll wager he’d
make his fortune faster than any of us.”</p>

<p>After that, Dr. Brenton joined in one or two of the
councils, but his decision was arrived at more easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
than Mrs. Morland’s. He had only Max to think of,
and Sir Gerald said that a sea-voyage and a prolonged
residence in a fine climate would certainly save Max
for a useful maturity. The Doctor set his old dreams
aside, and made a final draw on “Examinations”. If
that hoarded fund would give his boy present ease and
future vigour, he could afford to wait patiently and let
the world slip by. Some day Max would find his life-work:
what it might be his father no longer cared to
anticipate. Enough to know that the crown of a worthy
manhood must be the unfailing reward of a generous
and unselfish youth.</p>

<p>At last Mrs. Morland spoke.</p>

<p>“Children, I think that we will go. Jim ought to
have his chance, and we don’t wish to separate.
That, after all, sums up everything for the present, so
the question is answered easily enough.... Now,
we must not keep back Mr. Lessing, and he is kindly
anxious to take us with him. Besides, let us remember
Max, whose hope of health depends, it seems, on a
quick departure. We must help each other to make
haste.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We cannot here follow our three young Altruists
into their busy lives across seas; but we know that
they will ever be the best of comrades, and never
better than when sharing willing labours in the service
of all who need their aid.</p>

<p>Frances’s motto, “Help Others”, was faithfully
cherished in her old home. Woodend kept up
constant communication with the Creek Farm, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
still hoped some day to welcome the wanderers back.
Meanwhile, a branch “Society of Altruists” was
started in the new home in the far southern continent;
and Antipodean school-fellows of Frances and
Austin became oddly familiar with a certain corner
of Old England, and with the girls and boys who
worked and played together there.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
